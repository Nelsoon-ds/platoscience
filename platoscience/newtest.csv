Unlike traditional methadone clinics that offer just one type of medication, our treatment center offers several options, including methadone, buprenorphine, Suboxone, and naltrexone. Our experts carefully select a medication that is optimal for each patient and continually monitor the dosage to help ensure that the patient stays on track with their treatment goals. MAT has been acknowledged as an effective way of promoting long-term recovery from opioid addiction by highly respected organizations, such as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Decades of research shows that people who participate in MAT services for opioid addictions have better recovery outcomes than people who do not.   MAT incorporates the use of both prescription medication and therapy sessions to address the mental and physical elements of opioid addiction. You can participate in group and individual counseling, both of which can provide you with the opportunity to explore your substance use history, consider your goals for the future, and discuss any concerns you may have. In group sessions, you can connect with other adults at Wausau CTC who are facing similar challenges and use newly formed bonds as an added source of support during treatment. Individual counseling sessions can allow you to engage in deep discussions with a professional in a confidential, one-on-one setting. We encourage you to be present and make the most of your time at our treatment center, as we believe that the more invested you are in your own recovery, the more successful you can be. You can play an active role in your treatment by speaking up in counseling sessions and asking questions that may arise concerning opioid addiction, the MAT process, or any other relevant topics.   Your experience at Wausau CTC will begin with an initial assessment. Our professionals will use the results of this assessment, along with verbal feedback you provide, to craft an individualized treatment plan that is customized to your specific needs. You can feel comfortable knowing that our staff members will strive to support you physically, mentally, and emotionally during your time at our treatment center. While medication can help alleviate the physical symptoms of withdrawal, it takes commitment to addressing the psychological factors of addiction to fully heal. When you are ready to seek treatment, our compassionate staff is here to encourage you as you work to face challenges, overcome obstacles, and achieve lasting recovery.

MAT is designed to help people who are struggling with addictions to heroin, prescription painkillers, and other opioids. By easing cravings and painful withdrawal symptoms, the medications used in MAT can help people find recovery from opioid addictions. Unlike many methadone clinics that offer only one medication option, we can prescribe buprenorphine, Suboxone, and Vivitrol, in addition to methadone. These medications are FDA-approved to treat opioid use disorder and have been shown to reduce the likelihood of relapse. During their time in treatment, patients also have the opportunity to participate in group and individual counseling sessions. This component of MAT promotes support and encouragement throughout the recovery journey.   If you have an addiction to opioids and are seeking help, you can call our admissions team to schedule an initial appointment. When you arrive at our treatment center, you will undergo a comprehensive assessment, a urine drug screen, and a medical screening as part of the intake process. Based on the assessment results, you may receive a prescription for methadone, buprenorphine, Suboxone, or Vivitrol. As you progress through treatment, members of our medical staff will monitor your progress and may adjust your medication and dosage as needed. These medications are effective treatments for opioid use disorder, but medication alone cannot address the complex emotional and behavioral aspects of addiction. MAT also includes individual and group counseling sessions so that people can learn healthy coping skills and tools for lasting recovery. These therapy sessions can help you find a support network, gain valuable insights into personal triggers, and learn how to live a healthier, happier life.   At Green Bay CTC in Green Bay, Wisconsin, we understand that every person who seeks opioid addiction treatment has unique experiences, needs, and goals for treatment. We collaborate with our patients and encourage them to take ownership of their recovery process. Counseling is a significant component of medication-assisted treatment and allows patients to explore why they began to use opioids in the first place. In individual and group therapy sessions, people can gain insight into their struggles with addiction, connect with others who have similar stories, and learn positive lifestyle changes to promote transformative growth. It takes courage to seek opioid addiction treatment, and we deeply appreciate your commitment to self-improvement and long-term recovery. At Green Bay CTC, we strive to make every patient’s time in MAT a beneficial and meaningful experience. If you are looking for opioid addiction treatment, we urge you to give us a call.

Our center specializes in providing medication-assisted treatment (MAT), an evidence-based approach to treating opioid addiction. MAT combines therapy with prescription medication to comprehensively treat the physical and psychological aspects of opioid addiction. In MAT, medications like methadone can help alleviate opioid cravings and the painful symptoms that often accompany opioid withdrawal. In addition to medication, therapy plays a crucial role in helping people achieve and maintain long-term recovery. In group and individual therapy, people can learn healthy coping strategies to deal with the stress and challenges that can come with recovery. Therapy sessions also provide an outlet for people to share their struggles, find encouragement, and build relationships with others.   When you arrive at our Madison, Wisconsin, methadone clinic, a friendly member of our team will greet you. One of your first steps will be to complete a thorough intake assessment, which includes a physical assessment and drug screen. We will also ask you about your medical history, opioid use, and goals for treatment. This information will help us determine which medication and therapies are right for you. After your assessment, one of our clinicians may give you a prescription for Suboxone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, or methadone. You may also receive a schedule of individual and group therapy sessions to attend. These therapy sessions are led by trained and empathetic professionals in a safe and welcoming environment. In therapy, people can learn why they started using opioids in the first place and how they can find freedom. Group therapy offers a supportive setting where people can meet other adults who are facing similar challenges. These services are designed to provide support so that you can regain control of your life and build a solid foundation for continued recovery.   At Madison East CTC, we provide excellent opioid addiction treatment for adults who have developed addictions to heroin, prescription painkillers, and other opioids. Our treatment center is conveniently located less than 80 miles west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and is easily reached by I-90. At Madison East CTC, our goal is to create a supportive and welcoming environment where everyone can get the help they need without fear of judgment. Our dedicated team is committed to helping people find success in ending opioid use by participating in medication-assisted treatment, empowering them to lead lives free of addiction. It takes courage to reach out for help, and we make it easy to get the opioid addiction treatment you deserve. We prioritize accessibility by offering flexible appointment scheduling by phone 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Reach out today to learn how MAT can help you find lasting recovery from opioid addiction.

Our intensive outpatient program serves adults age 18 and older who are struggling with substance use disorders. We offer a variety of effective treatment modalities to promote the success of each person in our IOP, including weekly individual and family therapies and intensive group therapy multiple times a week. Those who participate in our IOP usually remain in treatment for about 12 weeks depending on their needs. During this time, they take part in programming three evenings a week for about three hours each day. IOP services can be ideal for people who need more support than what is available in traditional outpatient therapy but do not need round-the-clock care. An IOP may also be valuable in helping people transition back to daily life after participating in an inpatient or residential program. In Burkwood’s IOP, adults work with a team of qualified and caring counselors to achieve their recovery goals.   Our IOP is built around a robust schedule of group therapy sessions, which can include process groups, recovery groups, and relapse prevention groups. We also provide group sessions that draw on various treatment modalities, which may include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and the 12-Step recovery model. During our IOP groups, participants may discuss topics like coping skills, self-esteem, boundaries, healing from trauma, and other subjects that might be relevant and helpful for their recovery. Depending on their needs, clients in our IOP may also receive medication-assisted treatment (MAT) from a personal provider during their time with us. We want our IOP to be a valuable steppingstone on the road to long-term recovery. So we also provide personalized aftercare planning for each person in our program to ensure that they have the resources and referrals they need to sustain their progress. In our premier IOP, we are dedicated to ensuring that clients receive evidence-based and high-quality care that can help them lead healthier lives.   At our outpatient treatment center in Hudson, Wisconsin, near Minneapolis, we take pride in providing compassionate and effective care for clients. In our IOP, we welcome adults who are stepping down from our residential program as well as those who are starting care at Burkwood Treatment Center for the first time. When you participate in our premier IOP, you will receive care that is based on a detailed assessment of your needs. Personalized treatment is a cornerstone of care at our outpatient location, and we ensure that each person in our IOP follows an individualized care plan. Throughout your time in our outpatient program, you’ll have the chance to receive dedicated professional support while being able to continue living at home and attending to your daily responsibilities. You can also practice skills that you learn in our IOP in daily life. Receiving outpatient care for a substance use disorder can be life-changing, and we at Burkwood are ready to be a part of your unique recovery journey.
