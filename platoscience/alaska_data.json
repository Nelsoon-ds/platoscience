Treatment","What to Expect","Our Comprehensive Treatment Center","Located in Anchorage, Alaska, Anchorage Comprehensive Treatment Center (CTC) offers medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for adults who are struggling with an opioid addiction. Medication-assisted treatment is different from other forms of outpatient care in that it incorporates the use of both prescription medication and counseling. Medications used in MAT have shown to decrease the severity of withdrawal symptoms that often occur when someone stops using opioids, allowing participants to function in their day-to-day lives. This includes the time they spend in counseling, which addresses the behavioral, emotional, and social aspects of addiction. During these sessions, adults can better understand their past choices, address negative emotions, and make lifestyle changes that can lead to long-term recovery. Receiving MAT also makes people less likely to seek out illicit drugs and provides them with positive coping mechanisms. With effective medication and counseling, individuals can discover that there is hope for a better tomorrow.","en",[506,511,515],{"type":507,"languages":508},"emergency",[509],{"languageCode":504,"quote":510},"In response to COVID-19, we are adhering to the CDC's heightened preventive measures to ensure the safety of our patients and staff.",{"type":512,"languages":513},"availability",[514],{"languageCode":504,"quote":456},{"type":245,"languages":516},[517],{"languageCode":504,"quote":518},"Insurance plans and payment options accepted vary based on level of care and patient needs.

Finding the right treatment center can be vitally important, and the dropdown filters make it easier to find the best fit for you or your loved one. \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003Cbr> \u003Cdiv itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Question\"> \u003Ch3 itemprop=\"name\">\u003Cstrong>How do treatment centers work?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Answer\"> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"text\"> There are treatment centers for individuals dealing with psychiatric issues as well as for those dealing with \u003Ca href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction/treatment-addiction\" title=\"substance use or addiction\">substance use or addiction\u003C/a>, or who are dealing with both, also known as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/co-occurring-disorders\" title=\"co-occurring disorders\">co-occurring disorders\u003C/a>. The type of program that is right for an individual depends on their medical and mental health history, the severity of the issues they are dealing with, as well as their treatment goals. Individuals using the directory can filter to find a center best-suited to them based on their gender, the issues they are facing, such as addiction or a mental health condition, or the type of treatments they are seeking. \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003Cbr> \u003Cdiv itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Question\"> \u003Ch3 itemprop=\"name\">\u003Cstrong>What is the difference between inpatient and outpatient treatments?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Answer\"> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"text\"> In an inpatient or residential treatment program, individuals receive treatment while living in a facility and have 24/7 access to care by medical professionals. There are various forms of outpatient treatment that offer different levels of care, including Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs) and Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHPs). PHPs tend to offer more time-intensive, supervised care than IOPs. Aftercare is another option that offers ongoing treatment for an individual recovering from substance use or addiction after they have achieved initial sobriety, which can take the form of either an inpatient or outpatient program. \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003Cbr> \u003Cdiv itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Question\"> \u003Ch3 itemprop=\"name\">\u003Cstrong>How long is rehab?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Answer\"> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"text\"> Short term treatment usually lasts less than 30 days, while long term programs can last 60 days, 90 days, or longer, depending on the needs and goals of the individual and the structure of the program. Individuals searching for a treatment program in the directory can filter results by duration. \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003Cbr> \u003Cdiv itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Question\"> \u003Ch3 itemprop=\"name\">\u003Cstrong>How much does rehab cost?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Answer\"> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"text\"> The price of treatment varies according to the length and type of service you search for, such as detox treatment, residential treatment, or outpatient treatment, as well as location and amenities offered. Non-profit centers are typically less expensive than private centers, but may have longer wait lists. Using the filters on the Psychology Today Treatment Center Directory can help narrow down which centers accept insurance plans, and, if so, which ones. \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003Cbr> \u003Cdiv itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Question\"> \u003Ch3 itemprop=\"name\">\u003Cstrong>Does insurance cover rehab?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Answer\"> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"text\"> Health insurance typically covers rehab, but the extent of coverage depends on the particular policy, the treatment provider, and the needs of the individual. Individuals are encouraged to check with their insurance providers prior to entering a treatment program. Once you have confirmed coverage, you can use the Insurance filter on the Psychology Today Treatment Center Directory to find and contact centers that accept your insurance. \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003Cbr> \u003Cdiv itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Question\"> \u003Ch3 itemprop=\"name\">\u003Cstrong>How do you get someone who refuses treatment into rehab?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Answer\"> \u003Cdiv itemprop=\"text\"> It is important to convey compassion and understanding toward an individual dealing with an addiction problem. If a person refuses treatment at first, it’s important for their loved ones to continue to express their concerns in a kind and respectful manner, and to periodically \u003Ca href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction/how-help-someone-who-is-addicted\" title=\"encourage them to get help\">encourage them to get help\u003C/a>. It can take time for someone dealing with addiction to gain the motivation to make a change. In the meantime, it can be helpful for loved ones to set boundaries with the individual and educate themselves on the many treatment options that exist in order to have more informed conversations regarding recovery. \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003C/div> \u003Cbr> \u003C/div>",[],"Region

The practice uses exercises that relax people, bringing them to an altered state of consciousness. This process focuses on mastering self-awareness. Through trance-like analysis, hypnosis decreases blood pressure and heart rate, putting one's physical body at ease. Working with memories, hypnotherapy helps a person to reframe, relax, absorb, dissociate, respond, and reflect. The process reconstructs healthier associations with a person's past events.
