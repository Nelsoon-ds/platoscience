Our intensive outpatient program serves adults age 18 and older who are struggling with substance use disorders. We offer a variety of effective treatment modalities to promote the success of each person in our IOP, including weekly individual and family therapies and intensive group therapy multiple times a week. Those who participate in our IOP usually remain in treatment for about 12 weeks depending on their needs. During this time, they take part in programming three evenings a week for about three hours each day. IOP services can be ideal for people who need more support than what is available in traditional outpatient therapy but do not need round-the-clock care. An IOP may also be valuable in helping people transition back to daily life after participating in an inpatient or residential program. In Burkwood’s IOP, adults work with a team of qualified and caring counselors to achieve their recovery goals.   Our IOP is built around a robust schedule of group therapy sessions, which can include process groups, recovery groups, and relapse prevention groups. We also provide group sessions that draw on various treatment modalities, which may include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and the 12-Step recovery model. During our IOP groups, participants may discuss topics like coping skills, self-esteem, boundaries, healing from trauma, and other subjects that might be relevant and helpful for their recovery. Depending on their needs, clients in our IOP may also receive medication-assisted treatment (MAT) from a personal provider during their time with us. We want our IOP to be a valuable steppingstone on the road to long-term recovery. So we also provide personalized aftercare planning for each person in our program to ensure that they have the resources and referrals they need to sustain their progress. In our premier IOP, we are dedicated to ensuring that clients receive evidence-based and high-quality care that can help them lead healthier lives.   At our outpatient treatment center in Hudson, Wisconsin, near Minneapolis, we take pride in providing compassionate and effective care for clients. In our IOP, we welcome adults who are stepping down from our residential program as well as those who are starting care at Burkwood Treatment Center for the first time. When you participate in our premier IOP, you will receive care that is based on a detailed assessment of your needs. Personalized treatment is a cornerstone of care at our outpatient location, and we ensure that each person in our IOP follows an individualized care plan. Throughout your time in our outpatient program, you’ll have the chance to receive dedicated professional support while being able to continue living at home and attending to your daily responsibilities. You can also practice skills that you learn in our IOP in daily life. Receiving outpatient care for a substance use disorder can be life-changing, and we at Burkwood are ready to be a part of your unique recovery journey. To find out whether our IOP may be right for you, we encourage you to contact our admissions team today.

We provide medication-assisted treatment (MAT), a comprehensive approach to opioid addiction treatment that uses prescription medication and counseling to help people withdraw from opioids and begin working toward long-term recovery. Earlier methadone clinics typically offered one type of medication for patients. However, patients at our CTC can receive a prescription for methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, or Suboxone as part of their treatment plan. These medications can help ease the physical challenges of opioid withdrawal and allow patients to focus on the broader aspects of addiction recovery. MAT can effectively reduce a person’s risk for relapse as well as help them improve social functioning, stay in treatment, and maintain employment. It also provides the opportunity to build effective skills and strategies that can help a person remain in recovery.   Sheboygan CTC aims to offer patients a comprehensive treatment experience that sets the stage for ongoing success in recovery. At the heart of this approach is a patient’s individualized treatment plan. Typically, the patient experience at our CTC begins with a thorough assessment. We will work to assess your individual needs and create a treatment plan that can support them. We will also evaluate your health, history of drug use, and current drug use to determine the medication that may be most appropriate for you. While medication will form an important part of your treatment plan, your participation in our individual and group therapies can also be crucial for your recovery. In individual counseling, you can confidentially process your experiences and receive feedback and guidance from a qualified professional. In group therapy, you may learn new skills and exchange support with other people who are receiving MAT, which can help you feel more empowered and less alone in your journey.   Located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, our CTC is committed to providing focused services for everyone who receives treatment at our center. We offer a holistic approach to opioid addiction treatment that can address your physical, social, and emotional needs at the same time, helping you develop new behaviors and make healthy lifestyle changes for the future. Our qualified staff works to understand each patient as an individual, which includes learning how opioid addiction has impacted them specifically. We view the counseling component of your care plan as an integral part of your treatment through which you can craft your unique path to lasting recovery. With multiple medication options, personalized care, and individual and group therapies, we aim to provide each person who receives treatment at our center with the support they need to move forward toward a brighter future.

MAT is an evidence-based approach that combines the use of counseling and prescription medication to help people overcome opioid addiction. Individual therapy sessions can help patients address underlying causes of addiction through one-on-one discussions with experienced professionals, whereas group therapy sessions can provide a safe space for patients to connect with one another through larger, collaborative discussions. You can benefit from sharing experiences with peers who are facing similar challenges and building bonds that can serve as an added source of support during treatment. The use of prescription medication can keep you at ease during your time at our treatment center by alleviating uncomfortable symptoms of withdrawal. MAT has been studied for a significant amount of time and is scientifically proven to yield positive results in the treatment of opioid addiction.   Unlike traditional methadone clinics, our treatment center offers more than one type of medication. Options include methadone, naltrexone, buprenorphine, and Suboxone. Clinicians will carefully select a medication that will best support your recovery based on your medical needs, treatment goals, and history of substance use. We encourage you to take a proactive approach to your own treatment by discussing any concerns you may have throughout the process with our staff members. They can take the time to provide thorough explanations and guidance as you navigate recovery. We understand that no two recovery experiences look the same, and we honor that by customizing treatment plans that are based on the unique personal needs of each patient. We are committed to certain fundamental principles of care that promote a positive experience for our patients, like the expectation that services will be delivered with the utmost compassion and respect in a judgment-free environment.   Our treatment center boasts a lively, inspiring community that fosters support. At Racine CTC, we understand that seeking treatment for opioid addiction can be daunting, and we want to provide a welcoming space where people can feel accepted as they begin their journey to recovery. From the very beginning of treatment, you can receive care that is person-centered. Clinicians will perform an initial assessment to determine certain therapeutic elements of your treatment plan and will continually monitor your medication dosage to keep you comfortable and on track with your goals. Our MAT services can help you find the inner strength needed to overcome obstacles and camaraderie that will encourage you to continue on your path to recovery.

MAT is a research-supported, whole-person approach to treating opioid addiction that uses both prescription medication and counseling to help people withdraw from opioids and begin working toward long-term recovery. The medications offered in MAT can alleviate the physical challenges of opioid withdrawal, making it easier for patients to avoid relapse and achieve the functioning needed to engage in treatment and regular activities. During MAT, you can also receive support through individual and group counseling to address the emotional and behavioral aspects of addiction recovery. In counseling, you can learn from qualified professionals, process your feelings and experiences, and receive valuable support from peers. Additionally, by participating in MAT, you might enjoy other benefits, such as better employment outcomes and increased social functioning.   At River’s Shore CTC, we understand that our patients may have unique needs and goals. For this reason, we create and follow an individualized treatment plan for each person who receives care in our MAT program. In contrast with methadone clinics that offer only one type of medication for patients, our treatment center provides four medication options: methadone, buprenorphine, Suboxone, and naltrexone. Patients typically begin MAT by completing a comprehensive evaluation followed by an assessment of their health, history of substance use, and current substance use. Based on your individual needs, our professional staff will determine the medication that may be right for you as well as provide you with the opportunity to ask questions and learn more about MAT.

You may also feel tremendous shame, anger, and frustration about what’s happening in the present.

We lead teens ages 13-17 and families to sustainable healing through a continuum of care that includes our Therapeutic Day Program/PHP, Intensive Outpatient Program, and outpatient services. In CFF’s treatment programs, teens begin to build strong relationships, learn and practice healthy coping skills, grow their personal self-worth, and reestablish trust and communication with themselves and their loved ones. Our approach blends behavioral and medical treatment (integrated care) and provides both clinical and experiential modalities (integrative care). Each of our treatment programs encompasses evidence-based and solutions-focused components. Through support groups, clinical therapy, and psychoeducation, we involve the entire family in the healing journey - creating connection, cultivating compassion, igniting hope, and generating lasting change.   In CFF’s Therapeutic Day Program/Partial Hospitalization Program, teens’ weekly schedules include individual, group, and family therapy, as well as classroom hours and private tutoring. Every aspect of the Therapeutic Day Treatment Program is designed to support teens in gaining skills and self-knowledge as they learn new, healthy ways of navigating their world. The program encompasses CFF’s Therapeutic Day School, which provides an accredited curriculum designed to fit the needs of each adolescent, with a high staff-to-student ratio for individualized attention and tutoring. CFF’s Intensive Outpatient Treatment Program (IOP) provides comprehensive, integrated outpatient care to support teens to thrive while they maintain their current school schedule. This level of care is ideal for teens who will benefit from consistent, ongoing care on an outpatient basis. For teens enrolled in CFF’s outpatient services, we determine the appropriate adolescent outpatient track and treatment hours for each client according to the specific needs of the individual and family.   Our programming includes a wide range of comprehensive and tailored therapeutic offerings designed to address the underlying trauma and attachment wounds catalyzing teen mental health and co-occurring disorders. We recognize that the family is essential to healing, and our programming provides numerous opportunities for strengthening the family unit, including support groups and ongoing family therapy sessions. Our clinical staff is trained in multiple modalities, including Attachment-Based Family Therapy, a groundbreaking approach to healing the parent-child relationship. In individual and group therapy, teens gain self-knowledge and healthy coping skills through evidence-based modalities such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. Experiential modalities, including Adventure Therapy, yoga, and music and art therapy, promote teens’ self-esteem and self-expression while allowing them to process traumatic experiences. In our life skills training, teens strengthen their executive functioning and build the skills they need to move into the next stage of adolescence with confidence and enthusiasm.

Our services include outpatient substance abuse treatment, clinically integrated and supervised sober living, and outpatient mental health services. Our programs address the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of alcohol and drug addiction allowing individuals to return to work and family as they continue to heal.   To best fit the schedules and recovery needs of the individual, Hazelden Betty Ford offers multiple levels of outpatient care, including day treatment, intensive outpatient programming and continuing care at its St. Paul location.  For those that do not have a supportive home environment, a structured sober living option is available.    Hazelden Betty Ford's outpatient programs work under the same principles and practices as its residential programs, providing individualized focus within the program structure. Patients receive  psychological, social, and alcohol and other drug assessments, an individualized treatment plan, and continuing care recommendations. The patient's experience includes lectures, group therapy, one-to-one counseling with a licensed addiction counselor, Twelve Step meetings, spirituality work, and peer interaction.   Patients who come to us with opioid use disorder face unique challenges that can undermine rehab. The severity of withdrawal symptoms and cravings can drive patients to leave treatment prematurely. And prolonged use of heroin or other opioids fundamentally changes brain function in ways that increase the risk of relapse.  Because of the unique challenges in addressing opioid addiction, including an increased vulnerability to overdose and accidental death, Hazelden Betty Ford developed COR-12, a specialized treatment approach that involves the use of medications, extended continuing care and close monitoring of medication use.  If clinically appropriate, COR-12 may be recommended for you by one of our board certified addiction medicine physicians to:  Ease the discomfort of withdrawal, reduce cravings and help you engage more successfully in rehab.

We use the CARE Model, which stands for “consistent attuned relational eating.” This means patients have the steadiness of a dietary plan that is adaptable to what’s happening in their life.  We believe in Health at Every Size because everyone can be healthy regardless of size, shape, weight or BMI. We encourage Intuitive Eating — nourishing ourselves when we’re hungry and recognizing when we feel full. We utilize the All Foods Fit model, which celebrates that all foods are nourishment, and no foods are off-limits in moderation.  These core elements help our patients walk out of treatment feeling engaged, empowered and transformed so that they can manage long-term recovery. In fact, 86.5% of clients who completed treatment didn’t need to return to Center for Discovery or any other program for a higher level of care for eating disorder treatment.   We’re committed to providing you with continuous support during eating disorder recovery. That’s why you’ll automatically have access to Discovery for Life — free support that’s with you for a lifetime — upon completing treatment. Our support groups and virtual programming offer the encouragement patients need to navigate real-life recovery and continue after treatment with Discovery365 — a virtual safety net that’s personalized and controlled by you to keep you accountable and help prevent relapse especially within the first year. Reach out to one of our caring professionals today so we can begin your recovery together in a supportive environment.  Center for Discovery is in-network with all major insurance companies and provides complimentary benefit verification. We can work to obtain a single case agreement if necessary. “I know that every person responds different to treatment, but I believe this program overall has a very good style that can be much more helpful/healthy than any other program I’ve been to. The staff were incredibly accepting, supportive, and created a safe space for me to reach out for help as well as offer support when I needed it.. – CFD Alum  ", "specialties": "Eating Disorders, Child, Mood Disorders, Anxiety, Coping Skills, Depression, Emotional Disturbance, Family Conflict, Life Transitions, Medication Management, Obsessive-Compulsive (OCD), Peer Relationships, Personality Disorders, Relationship Issues, School Issues, Self Esteem, Self-Harming, Stress, Substance Use, Suicidal Ideation, Trauma and PTSD, Depression, Eating Disorder, Residential Inpatient, Small Residential Programs, Substance Use, Teens & Adolescent Residential, Long Term (>30 Days) Residential, Short Term (<30 Days) Residential, Cognitive Behavioral (CBT), Dialectical Behavior (DBT), Emotionally Focused, Family Systems, Integrative, Person-Centered, Strength-Based", "therapy_types": "Eating Disorders, Child, Mood Disorders, Anxiety, Coping Skills, Depression, Emotional Disturbance, Family Conflict, Life Transitions, Medication Management, Obsessive-Compulsive (OCD), Peer Relationships, Personality Disorders, Relationship Issues, School Issues, Self Esteem, Self-Harming, Stress, Substance Use, Suicidal Ideation, Trauma and PTSD, Depression, Eating Disorder, Residential Inpatient, Small Residential Programs, Substance Use, Teens & Adolescent Residential, Long Term (>30 Days) Residential, Short Term (<30 Days) Residential, Cognitive Behavioral (CBT), Dialectical Behavior (DBT), Emotionally Focused, Family Systems, Integrative, Person-Centered, Strength-Based", "conditions": "Eating Disorders, Child, Mood Disorders, Anxiety, Coping Skills, Depression, Emotional Disturbance, Family Conflict, Life Transitions, Medication Management, Obsessive-Compulsive (OCD), Peer Relationships, Personality Disorders, Relationship Issues, School Issues, Self Esteem, Self-Harming, Stress, Substance Use, Suicidal Ideation, Trauma and PTSD, Depression, Eating Disorder, Residential Inpatient, Small Residential Programs, Substance Use, Teens & Adolescent Residential, Long Term (>30 Days) Residential, Short Term (<30 Days) Residential, Cognitive Behavioral (CBT), Dialectical Behavior (DBT), Emotionally Focused, Family Systems, Integrative, Person-Centered, Strength-Based", "address": "Center For Discovery, Glenview, , 3737 Lawson Road, , , Glenview, IL 60026, , map, , , (844) 505-2914, Center For Discovery, Glenview, , 3737 Lawson Road, , , Glenview, IL 60026, , map, , , (844) 505-2914, Center For Discovery, Glenview, , 3737 Lawson Road, , , Glenview, IL 60026, , , , (844) 505-2914", "city": ["Center For Discovery, Glenview   3737 Lawson Road     Glenview"], "state": ["IL"], "zipcode": ["60026"], "website_link": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/profile/316691/website", "tags": ["tms", "erp", "depression", "ocd", "anxiety", "ptsd", "add", "psychiatrist", "therapist", "mental health professional", "behavioral health", "clinic", "hospital", "telehealth"]}
