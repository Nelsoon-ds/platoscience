    "first my crawler goes to a specific state by querying this \"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/treatment-rehab?search=Alaska\""
    then it goes to each of the clinics listed on that page and clicks on the profile-title in the html under the results-row-heading.
    That leads the cralwer to the clinic's profile page, where it finds more information on the clinic, such as the name, address, phone number and state etc.
    after the crawler has found that information it is supposed to go to the clinic's website and scrape the information from there.
    The problem is that the website is not directly accessible, but instead the crawler has to  use a button with a child tag <a> to get to the clinic's websites. the 
    class of that tag is "website-link" and the actual link is in the href attribute of that anchor tag. The anchor tag has this structure: "href="/us/profile/someid/website"
" where someid is a unique identifier for the clinic..
That takes me to a page that has a button with this class "<span class="website-interstitial-link" title="Still here? This way" data-v-ae95bcd2=""></span>"  that takes me
to the clinics homepage if I click on it. I want the crawler to click on that button and go to the page and parse the response set the website_link to be the actual clinics homepage
and also to then look for any about us page etc for more information.
